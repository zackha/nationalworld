The Millom Town Deal Board and Cumberland Council remain committed to delivering the Town Deal projects for the benefit of the Millom and Haverigg communities.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leader of Cumberland Council Mark Fryer added: \u201cThis will be an important step forward for the Millom Town Deal projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It is great to see progress being made.

She\u2019s very badly injured.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He had struck her three times in the head with an ice axe, with a pick at on end and a blade at the other. This left her bleeding heavily and struggling to speak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A guest at the property had heard raised voices in the hours before the attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Prosecutor Tim Evans told Carlisle Crown Court a neighbour then heard shouting which stopped when there was a thump and the sound of something heavy hitting the floor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Holden told the first police officer to arrive at the scene she might drop dead at any second. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He described in the aftermath how the weapon went right through her skull, also telling police: &#8220;I actually meant to murder her\u201d; \u201cI think I made a big mistake\u201d; and \u201cI\u2019ve been mentally quite unwell\u201d.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On leaving the address, Holden told his wife: \u201cI\u2019m going to jail. I\u2019m so sorry. I love you.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The woman described being attacked by her husband after he called her to a bedroom and sat her on a bed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was taken initially to Carlisle\u2019s Cumberland Infirmary but then transferred to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle due to the severity of her injuries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She had suffered a fractured skull and brain bruising, but had since made a successful recovery and was intending to return to work a a therapist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Holden was described as being delusional and paranoid during the months before his attack, and anxious about undiagnosed health problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His wife told police she was aware of him previously drinking, taking drugs and not working. She told police she didn\u2019t want to press charges or get him into trouble, instead saying she wanted him to receive professional help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Holden, initially charged with attempted murder, admitted the lesser alternative offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was sentenced at the crown court this afternoon, when Judge Nicholas Barker revealed Holden\u2019s wife had written him a letter, pleading for mercy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judge Barker also considered detailed background information including what he said was a helpful, thoughtful and balanced report from a psychiatrist who had spoken of a challenging assessment of Holden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI do accept, Daniel Holden, that you are deeply remorseful for your actions,\u201d the judge told him as he passed sentence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Judge Barker said of the attack: \u201cWithin your mental state there was a premeditation to your actions. This was not an off-the-cuff, spontaneous event.\u201d</p>\n",

Those attending can tuck into a traditional Burns supper of haggis, neeps and tatties and the event is also streamed live on YouTube and Facebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Graham Main, executive producer and founder of Big Burns Supper, said: \u201cWe\u2019re really excited by the quality and breadth of this year\u2019s programme. With 150 events at more than 30 venues, there truly is something for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBig Burns Supper is about celebrating the life and work of Scotland\u2019s national poet, Robert Burns, but not in a way that\u2019s dry or academic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur aim is to create a festival that\u2019s accessible and inclusive, bringing Burns to a wider audience and showing that he\u2019s as relevant today as he\u2019s ever been.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Red Bus Bistro, which runs gastro tours around Edinburgh and Glasgow in an adapted London Routemaster bus, is bringing its double-decker to Big Burns Supper on January 25 and 26.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaving from the Burns statue, passengers can enjoy authentic fare while taking in sites associated with Burns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Evening tours, for over-18s, offer onboard entertainment and a traditional Burns supper, or vegetarian alternative, washed down with a dram. Family-friendly daytime trips without whisky have haggis pies instead of the supper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Renowned taster Professor Robertson Wellen, who has more than 17,000 followers on his Pour1malt Instagram channel, will lead two tutored tastings at Ferintosh Guest House, in Lovers Walk, on January 25.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information and to book, visit <a href=\"https://bigburnssupper.com/\">https://bigburnssupper.com/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Big Burns Supper was founded in Dumfries in 2012 to celebrate the life and legacy of Burns who produced some of his greatest work while living at Ellisland Farm just north of the town.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Big Burns Supper had to be postponed last year as the Scottish Government removed the Scotland\u2019s Winter Festival fund.</p>\n",

We can pass your details on to the relevant coach. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The U14 and U16 boys teams are both playing in the Cumbria Cup final this year with several other boys and girls teams still in this and other competitions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are a very inclusive squad and our club is a great place to learn a sport with a position for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Most importantly though it\u2019s to make friends and have fun. We hope to see as many new players for the free taster session.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Players are asked to bring trainers &#8211; or boots if they have them &#8211; and comfortable sporty clothes.</p>\n",

Picture: Google Streetview</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A \u00a32.15m plan to revamp homes on a Barrow Street have been ditched &#8211; and will focus on another area of the town instead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, it was announced The Housing Market Renewal Scheme, part of the Brilliant Barrow Town Deal, was initially going to revitalise a number of properties on Rawlinson Street and Barrow Island. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it was announced today, Monday January 6 2025, that the scheme will change focus to improve six flats in Steamer Street, and public realm improvements around Steamer Street and Egerton Court.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a Town Deal spending deadline of March 2026, the town deal board agreed that the changing the focus would have a more positive impact and be achievable.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schooner Street is Grade II listed and Steamer Street Grade II* listed. Barrow Island Conservation Area was recently described as one of the most distinctive conservation areas in the North West.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0Six flats in the Steamer Street block will act as examples on how to retrofit apartments of traditional solid-wall construction.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could include work to improve the thermal performance, material to help combat mould, repairs and/or replacement of windows and doors, internal insulation, lime plastering and breathable wall finishes.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new housing officer role will also be created to work closely with tenants and stakeholders to identify hazards within the current housing stock and act on behalf of tenants to protect their rights.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project, Brilliant Barrow said, aimed to provide investment in residential properties to generate positive outcomes for residents, the wider community and the environment \u2013 as well as demonstrating the benefits to landlords to improve other flats in the area.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of Westmorland and Furness Council&#8217;s Community Power agenda, the council\u2019s locality team, dedicated community development officer on Barrow Island, the council&#8217;s safe and strong team, health and third sector partners and the community have been working together to give the community a great say on improvements they would like to see locally, the authority said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project \u2013 with a budget of \u00a32.154m, including \u00a350,000 from Historic England \u2013 will be supported by a creative engagement strategy, which will look to build relationships with residents, understand their underlying issues and identify ways of supporting them.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The council will work with the community to design significant public realm improvements at Steamer Street and Egerton Court, building on previous work done to public spaces on Barrow Island, it said. \u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan Brook, leader of Westmorland and Furness Council and deputy chair of the Brilliant Barrow Board, said: \u201cThis investment from Brilliant Barrow will not only help to protect these buildings for the future, it will actively improve the standard of living they offer to residents and demonstrate to landlords the benefits of doing such work themselves.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe benefits will be felt more widely in the community too as the improved street scene provides a positive impact upon the wellbeing of people in the local area.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Health and wellbeing outcomes within Barrow are significantly worse than the national average, and for people growing up and living in Barrow Island the outcomes are among the worst in the area. This work can the catalyst for real change which will make a real difference to people&#8217;s lives.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working with Westmorland and Furness Council, the Brilliant Barrow Town Deal is using \u00a325 million from the Government\u2019s Towns Fund to deliver a suite of ambitious projects to help transform the town for future generations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brilliant Barrow&#8217;s Housing Market Renewal project was set up with the aims of improving the conditions of housing and commercial stock in Barrow, delivering more energy efficient homes and delivering positive health and wellbeing impacts for the households of improved properties.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve Cole, CIO and operational improvement director at BAE Systems and chair of the Brilliant Barrow Town Deal Board, said: \u201cThis is an exciting project that will be hugely beneficial for people, the wider community and for the environment.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI look forward to seeing the work get under way so that the positive impacts can be felt as soon as possible.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n",

The football club meets every Monday at Carlisle Campus Sports &#8211; Harraby 3G, on Edgehill Road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben, who weighed 16 stones when he joined, said: \u201cI\u2019ve always struggled with gaining excessive weight, which has, in turn, always led to a decline in my mental health. The only period in my life that I felt happy at a given weight was when I played football weekly but unfortunately that was no longer something I did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I remember I was driving through Carlisle one Saturday afternoon and I saw an advertising board for the club. I immediately pulled over and looked up what Man v Fat was, as it wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d seen before. In all honesty I thought it was too good to be true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It took me all of two minutes to decide it was something I wanted to try and within hours of signing up to the waiting list, our Carlisle coach Beverley had contacted me. I immediately felt support, and any tiny doubts I may have had about committing to the club evaporated in one short phone call.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Man v Fat football sessions, players are weighed, before battling it out on the pitch where the results from matches combine with a player\u2019s individual weight loss throughout a week, to contribute to an overall league table. The programme isn\u2019t just about losing weight, with the men taking part also discovering its mental health benefits, while creating new friendships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben added: &#8220;The most enjoyable aspect of Man v Fat is the team aspect. The accountability of contributing to your team\u2019s performance on and off the pitch is the biggest motivation you can have to maintain the focus required to stay consistent and achieve your goals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Add to that the sense of togetherness among a group of like-minded individuals with a collective goal of losing weight makes for a wonderfully encouraging culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If these are values you believe in, then I would 100% recommend anyone to give it a go and get involved.&nbsp;Overall being part of the club has had a very positive impact on my life, opening countless opportunities, including a national seven-a-side tournaments and 11-a-side games with other clubs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I\u2019ve made good friends for life at this club and built a new level of confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Fast forward some 18 months and I\u2019m proud of the 30% weight loss I\u2019ve achieved, progressively improving until this season where I have managed to amass 15% weight loss in a single season.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More information about the club can be found at\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.manvfatfootball.org/carlisle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">manvfatfootball.org/carlisle</a></p>\n",

Keswick defended and defended well, but 15 minutes in key player Glen Weightman went down with a leg injury after jumping to block a kick from Morpeth&#8217;s Harvey Gillie, and after a delay, Weightman was carried from the field of play, clearly in pain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was little between the two sides, and Will Addyman was a force of nature pushing Keswick forwards, but Morpeth had the majority of possession and put points on the board from a penalty kick from Gillie on 25 minutes for 7-3.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with co-captain Aaron Thompson now also off injured, it was now Keswick&#8217;s turn to apply the pressure, and Keswick used a scrum deep into Morpeth territory to set up a driving maul which easily pushed back a faltering Morpeth defence for Jamie McKenzie to touch down, with this try again converted by Mewse. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"828\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Keswick-block-a-Morpeth-charge-Ben-Challis.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-337175\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Keswick-block-a-Morpeth-charge-Ben-Challis.jpg 828w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Keswick-block-a-Morpeth-charge-Ben-Challis-300x290.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Keswick-block-a-Morpeth-charge-Ben-Challis-768x742.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Keswick-block-a-Morpeth-charge-Ben-Challis-151x146.jpg 151w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Keswick block a Morpeth charge (Ben Challis)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It was nip and tuck, and Morpeth hit back with their own converted try, leaving the score a close 14-10 to Keswick at half time.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second half saw Addyman added to the injury list, and slowly Morpeth gained the ascendency. After repeated close range attacks on the Keswick try line, with Karl Smythe sin binned and Keswick down to 14 men, even with despite stout defence, Morpeth&#8217;s Theo Gavaghan finally found a gap, and Morpeth took a 14-15 lead with his unconverted try. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Keswick now on the back foot, and defending deep in their own half, Morpeth took a clear lead with a quick interception just 10 yards out and with the conversion now had a 14-22 lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They followed this up with another try for 14-29, but Keswick were not done, and a strong charge from Chris Potter was followed up by Henry Etisoy gaining valuable yards and Keswick gaining a penalty try when Mewse was denied a touch down when he was tackled running in for the loose ball.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"854\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/James-Benson-and-Matty-Roper-make-the-tackle-Ben-Challis.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-337174\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/James-Benson-and-Matty-Roper-make-the-tackle-Ben-Challis.jpg 854w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/James-Benson-and-Matty-Roper-make-the-tackle-Ben-Challis-300x281.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/James-Benson-and-Matty-Roper-make-the-tackle-Ben-Challis-768x719.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/James-Benson-and-Matty-Roper-make-the-tackle-Ben-Challis-156x146.jpg 156w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">James Benson and Matty Roper make the tackle (Ben Challis)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The gap was still eight points, and with the clock ticking down Keswick ran out of luck, chances and time, and had to settle for a noble defeat.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the game, Keswick coach Garry Holmes: said &#8220;We are extremely disappointed as a group. Once again we have competed well against one of the top four teams in the League for large periods of the game, but somehow come away with nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It was a great start to the game, firstly soaking up the pressure then creating an opportunity to score through really good transition from defence into attack. The injuries to Glen Weightman &#8211; his ankle, and we are waiting on the diagnosis &#8211; and then Aaron Thompson &#8211; to his neck &#8211; stalled our momentum as our leadership team had to be shuffled around mid-game.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"739\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ryan-Weir-sets-off-to-run-in-Keswicks-first-try-Ben-Challis.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-337176\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ryan-Weir-sets-off-to-run-in-Keswicks-first-try-Ben-Challis.jpg 739w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ryan-Weir-sets-off-to-run-in-Keswicks-first-try-Ben-Challis-277x300.jpg 277w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ryan-Weir-sets-off-to-run-in-Keswicks-first-try-Ben-Challis-135x146.jpg 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Ryan Weir sets off to run in Keswick&#8217;s first try (Ben Challis)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We were then disadvantaged when Karl Smyth was sent to the sinbin, leaving us with no regular lineout caller, and hit again when Will Addyman had to leave the field for medical assistance.\u00a0In the second half we were caught playing too much rugby in our own 22, and Morpeth took advantage of that, showing why they are a top side in the league.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The frustration ultimately fractured us on the day, and the bond we built before Christmas seemed to not be quite as strong on the pitch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always tough coming back just four days into the New Year, but these are challenges we need to look overcome.\u00a0We will go back to training and look to put these things right this week before heading to Consett, looking to close the gap to them as we chase sixth place in the League.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/2025/01/05/aspatria-and-consett-beat-the-big-freeze/\">In the only other game that was played on the Saturday, Aspatria lost 10-29 at home to Consett, with all other games postponed because of the weather.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This\u00a0Saturday, Keswick visit Consett who are one place above Keswick in the table.\u00a0</p>\n",

They had misnavigated off Scafell Pike summit, attempting to return to Seathwaite.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group had found themselves in Upper Eskdale; cold, wet and concerned for their safety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wasdale Mountain Rescue Team said: &#8220;They were not equipped properly for full winter conditions on the high fells, and were also inexperienced. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;At times they were waist deep in snow. To their credit, they fully acknowledged their misjudgement in this attempt and were humble and thankful for the help, fully aware this could have ended with a much worse outcome.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team called out the Coastguard helicopter and Wasdale Mountain Rescue Team sent out an advance party of two to find the walkers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team said: &#8220;Thankfully the advance party had not travelled too far when they met up with the party of five walking out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;All were safe and able to complete the journey to the road and then to a local hostelry, where they could organise a taxi back to Borrowdale.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n",

So, the age appropriate challenges are missed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even the playground is now super safe where there is little chance of a fall resulting in the ubiquitous graze to the knee.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fewer kids walk to school.\u00a0Walking develops their decision-making and risk awareness skills when it comes to crossing the road (Green Cross Code?) where mummy and daddy molly coddle them by delivering them to the school gates and pick them up at the end of the day.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What this creates, according to the research, is increasing levels of mental health issues with younger people \u2013 anxiety disorder, depression both of which might lead to self harm and even suicide.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While suicide rates for young people are always concerning this is particularly true of two specific groups: firstly, university students who face life away from family and friends, now commonly known as their \u2018support group\u2019, who become isolated because they have not mastered the making of friendships.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second is young women who face the additional burden of dealing with body shaming as so many can never aspire to the perfect looks of the film stars or models.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even Facebook admitted in material leaked in 2021, that they were aware of the damage to young minds but, despite this, they continue to value their profits over the wellbeing of their users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what is to be done?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the challenge now faced by parents who will be confronted with that clarion call of \u201call my friends have a smartphone and are on WhatsApp/Instagram/SnapChat\u201d, etc.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Online Safety Act, passed just last year, is an attempt, be it very late, to try and limit the damage to young people and we should expect, nay demand, that the social media companies respect their customers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, closer to home, perhaps the local councils will be less eager to post their \u2018this is what to do when it snows, rains, or blows\u2019 and, instead, encourage people to develop and then exercise that level of common sense that everyone should be able to manage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do people really need to be told that driving onto Honister Pass or Wrynose (other passes are available) when it is freezing and/or snowing, is not a good idea when the evidence is there, plain to see in front of their eyes?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And why do we pander to them when they do?\u00a0 You get stuck on a high pass then don\u2019t expect the police or mountain rescue come to save you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What, you didn\u2019t pack a shovel in the boot of the car, or made sure your phone was fully charged?\u00a0 You don\u2019t have a blanket in the car, or drinks and snacks?\u00a0 What were you thinking?\u00a0 Well, not a lot\u2026..</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, those who are vulnerable may need to be supported but that support should come from their \u2018support group\u2019 and not become part of some narrative that requires councils and, yes, the media, to roll back the regime of \u2018this is what you need to know\u2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By reducing the emotional hand holding, we might, just might, recapture some of the common sense that is so sadly lacking today.</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"about-cumbria-cat\">About Cumbria Cat </h2>\n\n\n<p>Born in Cumberland and now back living in Cumberland, having spent most of the past 50 years in some place called Cumbria, this cat has used up all nine lives as well as a few others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always happy to curl up on a friendly lap, the preference is for a local lap and not a lap that wants to descend on the county to change it into something it isn\u2019t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After all, you might think Cumbria/Cumberland/Westmorland is a land forged by nature \u2013 the glaciers, the rivers, breaking down the volcanic rocks or the sedimentary layers \u2013 but, in reality, the Cumbria we know today was forged by generations of local people, farmers, miners, quarriers, and foresters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This cat is a local moggy, not a Burmese, Ocicat or Persian, and although I have been around the block a few times, whenever I jump, I end up on my feet back in my home county.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am passionate about the area, its people, past, present and future, and those who come to admire what we hold dear, be it lakes and mountains, wild sea shores, vibrant communities or the history as rich and diverse as anywhere in the world.</p>\n",

On balance, they probably wished the game had not survived the frost as Consett proved simply too good for the home side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consett\u2019s win almost certainly guarantees them a place in the league for next season but worries of getting dragged into the relegation mire continue to haunt Aspatria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment they have a respectable points cushion but with a tough run of fixtures looming their current advantage may be in danger of evaporating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aspatria won\u2019t offer excuses for what was, by their standards, a below-par performance, but the absence of key players due to injury remains a big concern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aspatria started the game with a spell of pressure that looked capable of sweeping Consett away. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this period the home side really should have taken the lead. The best chance came from a rolling maul that took the home pack and the ball to within inches of the line but was stopped short by some terrific Consett defending.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Barney-Clegg-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-337063\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Barney-Clegg-5.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Barney-Clegg-5-300x211.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Barney-Clegg-5-768x540.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Barney-Clegg-5-208x146.jpg 208w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Richard Miller winning lineout ball. Picture: Barney Clegg</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Following this initial flurry of positive play, Aspatria were hit by a majestic piece of rugby conjured up by the Consett fullback. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aspatria launched an aimless kick into his arms and from 65 yards out a weaving run ended up by the home posts with a number of defenders on their backsides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>10 minutes in and Consett held a 0-7 lead. At that early stage it was against the run of play but the score changed the mood of the game and Consett took full advantage to pen Aspatria into their half.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steven Stoddard did bring Aspatria back into the game with a long range penalty but all the attacking momentum remained with the visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aspatria went down to 14 men when second row Jude Wilkinson was yellow carded for an illegal tackle. This kick started a prolonged period of action close to the Aspatria line. The defence was initially good and the home side escaped unscathed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a short period it looked as if Aspatria might get back into the contention. Wilkinson rejoined the action just as a Consett\u2019s try scorer received a yellow card and in the process conceding field position in their 22. This was an opportunity for Aspatria to put a mark on the game but it was wasted.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"704\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Barney-Clegg-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-337064\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Barney-Clegg-6.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Barney-Clegg-6-300x206.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Barney-Clegg-6-768x528.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Barney-Clegg-6-212x146.jpg 212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Jamie Lightfoot breaking from a home scrum. Picture: Barney Clegg</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>With only a minute left in the first half, Aspatria scrum half Alex Barton was yellow carded and once again this put Consett in position to run a penalty. This time they did not miss and were over the line before the Aspatria defence could get itself fully into position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consett started the second period with a 3-12 advantage but quickly extended this. Within a few minutes the visiting hooker picked up a loose kick around halfway. It did not look particularly dangerous but his run up the left touchline was near enough unopposed and deep in the home 22 an easy offload delivered try number 3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversions were being missed and at 3-17 Aspatria should not have been out of this game. Played evened out but there were few signs of the home side having the ability to mount a realistic comeback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Into the final quarter and Consett were able to tighten their grip on the end result with a bonus point try.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a score of some skill. In the home 22 a delicate chip kick over the massed Aspatria defence was perfect for one of the Consett flyers to race onto and score.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The go forward remained with Consett and with 10 minutes remaining they added to the 3-22 score line, ending any faint hope of an Aspatria recovery. Indeed, Aspatria had saved their best until last.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the final minutes of the game Aspatria were able to deliver rugby that pushed Consett back against the try line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The defence became increasingly desperate and in the process Consett suffered another yellow card. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The push continued and Jamie Lightfoot at No8 found enough of a gap to squeeze through for a consolation score.</p>\n",

Mirehouse eventually advanced into the semi- final after winning 6-5 on penalties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second round of the Benevolent Cup, Premier Division outfit Maryport Athletic booked a quarter final spot after goals from Ethan Weir, Alec Little, Jack Kemp and Ciaran Laverty gave them a 4-0 victory against Unisun Athletic Youth Development from the league below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Division One side Workington Juniors are also into the Quarter Final of the Benevolent Cup after they beat Whitehaven Miners Social from the Premier Division 2-0 with goals from Harry Watson and Jack Nixon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Division One, A Carl Denver hat trick helped Whitehaven AFC Reserves to a 4-0 win against Dearham United with the other goal coming from Conner Kilgour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Windscale Reserves earned themselves a 6-1 victory against Silloth with Bobby Fitzpatrick (2), Jack Fitzpatrick, Ben Mahaffy, Leo Brennan and Kian Hoey all scoring. Kris Nichol got Silloth goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Premier Division match between Aspatria and Unisun Athletic and the Benevolent Cup semi final tie featuring Bransty Rangers and Wigton Harriers were both postponed due to the weather.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next Saturday fixture, league matches are 2pm kick-off with cup matches kicking off at 1.30pm.</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"premier-division\">Premier Division\u00a0</h2>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Aspatria v Unisun Athletic&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cleator Moor Celtic Reserves v Whitehaven Miners Social</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"division-one\">Division One </h2>\n\n\n<p>Mirehouse v Whitehaven Miners Social Development&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Unisun Athletic Youth Development v Silloth</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Windscale Reserves v Dearham United</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Workington Juniors v Whitehaven AFC Reserves&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conway-cup-semi-final\">Conway Cup semi-final</h2>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Keswick v Cockermouth\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"benevolent-cup-quarter-final\">Benevolent Cup quarter final</h2>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Wigton Harriers v Bransty Rangers&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cockermouth Reserves v Maryport Athletic&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n",

This means it is important to read each warning to know what level of impact to expect in your local area \u2013 and how likely those impacts are to occur. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Met Office began issuing impact-based warnings in 2011 \u2013 which means that warnings are issued when the weather may have an impact on people\u2019s day to day lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous to this, warnings were issued to the public when certain weather thresholds or levels were reached.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Impact-based warnings take multiple factors into account \u2013 these include time of day, if it may impact traffic, time of year, if the weather is unusual, if there are any seasonal events taking place and if the area is well equipped to deal with the weather.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each warning level is designed to help people take steps to minimise the chances of disruption in their lives.</p>\n",

She started her life at Great Yarmouth in 1935 and spent many years in the South West.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The showpiece vessel also worked on the River Thames, as well as playing a vital role in World War II during the Blitz by providing a vital route out of the city of Plymouth to the countryside each night.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listed on\u00a0the National Historic Ships Register and completely refurbished in November 2010, she continues to regularly carry passengers on Ullswater throughout the year/</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She is one of the five historic boats which sail on the lake throughout the year, including what\u2019s thought to be the world\u2019s oldest surviving passenger vessel \u2013\u00a0Lady of the Lake, launched in 1877.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peter Martin, skipper and operations manager at Ullswater \u2018Steamers\u2019 said:\u00a0\u201c2025 will be a very special year for Western Belle.\u00a0She has a special place in many people\u2019s hearts and has an interesting and varied history, not least providing an escape route for people during heavy bombing and machine gun raids in World War II.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cA less prestigious piece of trivia stems from her time in Maryport harbour.\u00a0 In 2009, the harbour gates were breached by a tidal surge during a storm, with much damage being suffered by other vessels in the harbour.\u00a0 Western Belle, however, escaped without harm!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to see her continuing to create such positive, memorable experiences for people 90 years after her original launch and we wish her well in her birthday year.\u201d</p>\n",

Thank you for your patience. Please be assured that our crews are doing everything they can to ensure that all missed collections are completed.&#8221;</p>\n",

Proactive planning, including exploring trust structures tailored to your needs can help protect family wealth and mitigate future tax liabilities.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tax-efficient asset disposals \u2013 With immediate changes to Capital Gains Tax (CGT) rates and a four per cent rise in the Business Asset Disposal Relief (BADR) rate from April 6 2025, followed by an additional four per cent increase the next year, careful planning of share or asset sales is essential. There\u2019s still time to benefit from the lower BADR rate. Seeking expert guidance now can help you minimise tax implications before the threshold changes take effect.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Salary versus benefits \u2013 Consider exchanging a portion of your salary for contributions to an approved share scheme or increased pension payments to lower your tax liabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone\u2019s tax planning approach is unique, tailored to their income, assets, and aspirations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, before you make any big decisions, take a moment to review your finances and align your tax planning with your long term goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you prepare your plans for 2025 and beyond, consider that a tax strategy meeting with our team of specialists could be one of the best decisions you make this year.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"contact-us-today-by-calling-0800-234-6978-or-emailing-infolamontpridmore-co-uk\">Contact us today by calling 0800 234 6978 or emailing <a href=\"mailto:info@lamontpridmore.co.uk\">info@lamontpridmore.co.uk</a></h3>",

Amadou Doumbouya had also left the club.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That left him with a threadbare squad for the trip to Hebburn with a goalkeeper and four inexperienced teenagers his only options on the bench.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The club has served a seven-day notice of approach to a National North Club for two players but there will be no movement on that front before Saturday\u2019s testing home fixture versus in-form Guiseley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hebburn, who have had a brilliant first season at Step 3, were awarded a penalty just four minutes into the game when Steven Rigg was adjudged to have tripped Joao Pedro Gomes Carrington. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Workington might have sensed a bit of justice when Hebburn skipper, Amar Purewal, blasted his spot-kick out of the ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buoyed by the penalty reprieve, Reds settled and took the lead with a fine goal in the ninth minute. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"680\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tom-Stephenson.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-336529\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tom-Stephenson.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tom-Stephenson-300x199.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tom-Stephenson-768x510.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tom-Stephenson-220x146.jpg 220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Tom Stephenson</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Matty Clark and Kai Nugent worked the ball diagonally through to Tom Stephenson down the inside left channel and the youngster showed great composure as he advanced towards Kieran Hunter, then calmly slotted the ball past the \u2018keeper for a memorable maiden goal for the club.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Reds started to lose their tentative grip on the game and, gradually, the hosts fought their way back into contention with Liam Noble emerging as the stand-out performer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He took control of matters and deserved his man-of-the-match billing, displaying the inspiration Workington clearly lacked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were back on terms in the 34th minute and Purewal atoned for his penalty miss by netting the equaliser, finding yards of space at the far post to convert with ease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was Noble who steered his side ahead with a fine finish a minute or so before the interval scoring a great team goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The visitors should, have restored parity almost immediately when a promising move down the left found Jamie Allen unmarked and onside at the far post. But he got caught in two minds and didn\u2019t know whether to take a touch or guide the ball home into the vacant net and, in the end, did neither.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The game was end-to-end in the second half with the hosts missing some gilt-edged chances and Alex Mitchell too often called upon as the last line of defence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reds were more laboured going forward and the final ball wasn\u2019t as crisp as it should have been.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They still had chances, though, although attempts from Allen, Stephenson, Rigg, Dav Symington and Lucas Wane hardly troubled Hunter in the home goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And any doubt about the outcome was resolved six minutes before the end of normal time when Town substitute Paul Van Zandvliet scored Hebburn\u2019s third to secure the three points and condemn Reds to an 11th loss of the season.</p>\n",

A fairly rapid thaw of lying snow is possible later on Sunday, although exactly how far north the rapid thaw will reach remains uncertain at this stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It said outbreaks of rain spreading north eastwards later on Saturday and overnight into Sunday will likely be preceded by a spell of snow on its northern flank. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there is a fair bit of uncertainty as to how far north this may spread, and how long any snow will last, significant accumulations of snow are possible, especially (but not exclusively) on hills. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, parts of the Midlands, Wales and northern England are most at risk of disruption, where 5cm or more could accumulate fairly widely, with perhaps as much as 20cm-30cm over high ground of Wales and/or the Pennines. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, accompanied by strengthening winds, may lead to drifting of lying snow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, as milder air attempts to move northwards into southern and central areas, snow may turn to a spell of freezing rain for a time, adding to the risk of ice and treacherous conditions in some areas. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A fairly rapid thaw of lying snow is possible later on Sunday, although exactly how far north the rapid thaw will reach remains uncertain at this stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the Met Office added: &#8220;Given the uncertainties, it is quite likely this warning area and start/end times will be refined over the coming days as confidence increases in areas most likely to be impacted.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"957\" height=\"478\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-112232.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-336564\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-112232.png 957w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-112232-300x150.png 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-112232-768x384.png 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-112232-260x130.png 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 957px) 100vw, 957px\" /></figure></div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-should-i-expect\">What should I expect? </h2>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>There is a small chance that power cuts will occur and other services, such as mobile phone coverage, may be affected</li>\n\n\n\n<li>There is a slight chance that some rural communities could become cut off</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A small chance of injuries from slips and falls on icy surfaces</li>\n\n\n\n<li>There is a chance of travel delays on roads with some stranded vehicles and passengers, along with delayed or cancelled rail and air travel</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-should-i-care-about-weather-warnings\">Why should I care about weather warnings?</h2>\n\n\n<p>Weather warnings are issued to let people know what weather is in store for their area and what its impact could be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Met Office is the UK\u2019s official weather service and is responsible for issuing weather warnings to the public.There are three main levels of weather warning:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Yellow \u2013 which asks people to be prepared for disruption</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amber \u2013 which asks people to change plans that could be impacted by the weather and take action to protect themselves and their property</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Red \u2013 which is issued for weather that poses a danger to life and asks people to immediately take direct action to keep themselves and others safe from impacts of the weather</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Yellow and amber warnings represent a range of impact levels and likelihoods of. This means it is important to read each warning to know what level of impact to expect in your local area \u2013 and how likely those impacts are to occur. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Met Office began issuing impact-based warnings in 2011 \u2013 which means that warnings are issued when the weather may have an impact on people\u2019s day to day lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous to this, warnings were issued to the public when certain weather thresholds or levels were reached.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Impact-based warnings take multiple factors into account \u2013 these include time of day, if it may impact traffic, time of year, if the weather is unusual, if there are any seasonal events taking place and if the area is well equipped to deal with the weather.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each warning level is designed to help people take steps to minimise the chances of disruption in their lives.</p>\n",

The winners were chosen by AA inspectors for outstanding overall quality and high levels of customer care. The AA said the winners had excellent reputations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Campsite of the Year for the North West and the England overall winner was Skelwith Fold Caravan Park in Ambleside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has over 300 privately owned holiday homes and 150 touring pitches, plus glamping options including luxury safari suites, adventure safari tents and pods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AA said: &#8220;Located in a beautiful setting close to Windermere, in the grounds of a former mansion. Touring areas are dotted in paddocks around the extensively wooded grounds, and the all-weather pitches are close to the facilities.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Park Foot Holiday Park in Pooley Bridge was named most improved campsite of the year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Owned by the Allen family for over 70 years, the park was praised for its achievements in protecting wildlife and generating its own carbon-free power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AA also highlighted Park Foot&#8217;s investment in new guest facilities over the past 12 months, including a new development of luxury lodges and the creation of additional play facilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fiona Bell, a director of the park with her sister Barbara Allen, said the family was humbled and delighted at being named as England&#8217;s most improved park.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1020\" height=\"571\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Parkfoot-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-336444\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Parkfoot-1.jpg 1020w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Parkfoot-1-300x168.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Parkfoot-1-768x430.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Parkfoot-1-260x146.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Park Foot</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>She also paid tribute to Park Foot&#8217;s staff team which number almost 50 local people in the summer months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: &#8220;They have played a big part in helping us create features such new wildflower areas which provide vital foraging for honey bees, butterflies and other pollinators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One of our team has also started keeping bees in hives spread around the grounds, and they are already producing honey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Other green initiatives have included the introduction of wildlife corridors, the planting of new native hedges, and the installation of living habitats for animals and birds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;These features not only help sustain our flora and fauna, but are also much loved by holiday guests who have chosen our park because of its glorious natural surroundings.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Parkfoot-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-336443\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Parkfoot-2.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Parkfoot-2-300x168.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Parkfoot-2-768x431.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Parkfoot-2-260x146.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Park Foot</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The AA also commended Park Foot&#8217;s success in lowering its carbon footprint by installing over 400 solar panels to generate clean power for the park.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The family has additionally swapped four of its diesel vehicles for all-electric models, and installed charging points for the growing number of guests arriving in EVs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Park Foot won praise too for its community involvement which in the last year has seen it raise \u00a33,500 for Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team though a voluntary online booking donation scheme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another beneficiary of the park&#8217;s local fundraising work has been the Penrith and District Red Squirrel Group for which \u00a32,200 has been collected in the past 12 month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wonderful to have our efforts, and those of our park team, recognised by this AA award \u2013 and it&#8217;s certainly helped our year to finish on a high!&#8221; said Fiona.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

She had been tracking her husband&#8217;s progress on Helvellyn and noticed his phone hadn&#8217;t moved for a few hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was established that the man was probably out on his bicycle with the dog. Police confirmed that his vehicle was still at the holiday property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team along with Keswick and Langdale Ambleside teams, were called out to search the various routes up to the location being communicated by the man&#8217;s phone; close to the summit of \u00a0Helvellyn.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three search dogs and their handlers also joined the search.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Coastguard helicopter travelled from Prestwick and made numerous attempts to get into the area but due to low cloud and high winds they were unsuccessful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At about 1am, battling atrocious weather conditions, Patterdale and Keswick team members managed to reach the location identified and found the man&#8217;s bike and phone, close to the edge of the summit plateau.\u00a0However there was no sign of the man or his dog.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At around 1.30pm, with weather conditions deteriorating further, the decision was made to call off the search until first light for the safety of the team members involved.\u00a0 The last party cleared the fell at about 3.30am.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday,  Monday December 30, at 8am, members from Cockermouth, Penrith and Kirkby Stephen and Patterdale rescue teams were briefed on the incident and made their way up to the Helvellyn summit plateau again.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A rope system was set up to enable them to descend the headwall down towards Red Tarn and search the area where the man was suspected to be.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Coastguard helicopter again attempted to access the area to assist with the search but due to conditions was still unable to help and landed at Patterdale. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the late morning it was confirmed that the dog had been found alive and well on a ledge on the headwall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly afterwards rescuers lowered down to the area found the man and confirmed that he had died as a result of the injuries sustained in a fall of around 590ft. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team said: &#8220;The man&#8217;s body was lowered by stretcher to the back of Red Tarn, then carried down to Greenside and transported back to Patterdale base where it was handed over to Cumbria police. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The whole incident took 20 hours to complete over two days and involved\u00a0 Patterdale, Keswick, Langdale Ambleside, Cockermouth, Penrith and Kirkby Stephen mountain rescue team members, three Lake District Search And Rescue Dogs and two Coastguard helicopters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In total 68 MRT rescue personnel were involved over the two days. We would like to send our condolences to the man\u2019s family and friends and our thanks to the various teams and helicopter crews who assisted with the search and subsequent recovery.&#8221;</p>\n",

We\u2019ve therefore taken the unfortunate decision to cancel\u00a0\u00a0this year\u2019s event.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re so grateful to everyone who had signed up, planned their dipping outfit and donated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The New Year\u2019s Day Dip has become a firm favourite in our fundraising calendar and a great community event to start the year. Rest assured we\u2019ll be back with bells on next year. In the meantime, we\u2019d like to wish all our dippers a very happy (and dry!) new year.\u201d</p>\n",

The two competitions will have the same points limit and regulations, but they will run as separate entities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is possible for riders to sign both for a club in the NDL and also a club in the National Trophy \u2013 maximising their track time and almost doubling their meetings at this level compared with 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Workington were among the teams listed for the National Trophy at the end of November, but it has now been revealed that they will not compete. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leicester will join Birmingham, Kent Eagles, King\u2019s Lynn and Plymouth in a league which provides four home and four away fixtures for riders, many of whom also have team places in the NDL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leicester\u2019s inclusion in the NDT does not change any of the one-to-sevens already announced by other teams in the competition, and they have selected from riders available at the time of their entry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>British Speedway chairman Rob Godfrey said: \u201cWith the timing of Workington making their decision, it was too late to move one of the (six) teams in the NDL across to the NDT, because they\u2019d all already started or completed building their teams by then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHowever, Leicester put up their hands straightaway and said they were willing to run two teams, and we\u2019re grateful to them for solving what would have been an imbalance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt still gives more riders more track time, which is exactly what we\u2019re looking to achieve \u2013 it fits what they want to do, and it fits what everyone wants to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt puts the NDT back to where we were originally, with five teams competing, and geographically it probably fits as well, so this is a positive outcome for all concerned.\u201d</p>\n",

They reminded people to always drive to the road conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The A66 between Penrith and Scotch Corner is closed to high sided and vulnerable vehicles due to strong winds. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Westmorland &amp; Furness Council&#8217;s advice is: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Stay indoors as much <a></a>as possible</li>\n\n\n\n<li> If you do go out, try not to walk or shelter close to buildings and trees. Trees and branches especially may be damaged during high winds</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keep away from the sheltered side of boundary walls and fences &#8211; if these structures fall, they will collapse on this side</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do not drive unless your journey is really necessary. If you do, take care when driving on exposed routes such as bridges or high open roads</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Cumberland Council&#8217;s advice is:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Secure any loose items around your home and garden, such as rubbish bins, trampolines, plant pots and garden furniture, to minimise the risk of floating debris and damage.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Speak in advance to vulnerable relatives, friends and neighbours &#8211; advise them and ensure they are prepared in case of power outages.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Check your torch batteries, radio and try to ensure phones are charged up in advance of the affected times.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Park vehicles in a garage if available &#8211; otherwise keep them clear of buildings, trees, walls and fences if possible.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Be aware of the weather warnings and avoid planning travel during this time if possible.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you must travel during this time do so with caution &#8211; pack your car with essentials, plan your route and listen to travel updates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stay clear of coastal areas during the affected times.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stay away from the fells well in advance of the affected times to keep you and mountain rescue volunteers safe.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do not drive through flood water if coming across flooding &#8211; take an alternative route.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do not touch any telephone or electrical cables that may have blown down.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Never drive through a road closure we\u2019ve put in place. Take an alternative route. Road closures are there for your safety.</li>\n</ul>\n",

</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the most prolific is Ben Challis, who is a regular sight at games across Cumbria and this year, has also worked with the England Community Lions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;d like to take this opportunity to thank Ben and everyone who submits photos for sports writer John Walsh&#8217;s match reports &#8211; we couldn&#8217;t do it without you!  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We asked Ben to pick his favourite images of 2024 &#8211; and he selected 20 to give a snapshot of sport this year in Cumbria. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, in no particular order, are Ben&#8217;s top shots of 2024: </p>\n\n\n<h2

The increased frequency in events being held within the marquee has now exceeded what was originally anticipated and has amplified the negative impacts, the report said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Events held at Dalston Hall Hotel between March 9 and October 30 this year received 49 separate objections from Dalston Hall Holiday Park, the report added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It said: &#8220;It should be noted that no complaints were received prior to the erection of the marquee when events were being held solely within the main hotel building.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In August, an investigation took place and concluded that noise disturbance continued to occur. Recorded music noise level was perceived as being over seven times louder than it should be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The council&#8217;s environmental health department collected data on September 14 and 15, which resulted in a noise abatement notice being served on the hall on October 3. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dalston Hall Venue Ltd has appealed the notice and environmental health officers will continue to visit the site until they are satisfied that the noise abatement<br>notice has been complied with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Supporting evidence will be submitted sometime towards the end of January. Dalston Hall Hotel will then decide whether to continue with their appeal, and if they do it would be likely that the appeal would be heard sometime in April 2025, planning officers said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Environmental health said: &#8220;There continues to be insufficient control of guests leaving the premises after events. As a result, noise nuisance from guests shouting and singing is being caused to neighbouring premises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The frequency of events held at the Hotel has significantly increased during 2024 and is predicted to continue to increase into 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Holding functions within the marquee will continue to result in complaints being received by this department.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In my opinion, the sound insulation properties of the marquee structure are not sufficient to adequately contain the levels of noise required by patrons wishing<br>to enjoy live bands and loud recorded music, without causing nuisance to neighbouring premises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The maximum level of music which will not cause nuisance is unlikely to be sufficient for guests and there will be a constant pressure to increase levels during events by live bands and DJs.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The manager of Dalston Hall Hotel said its own assessments have discovered the source of the noise. Findings suggested that it was not through the opening and closing of doors, but through the existing roofing cover on the marquee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cumbria police said there was no link between crime and use the marquee. However, it added, that its Neighbourhood Policing Team carried out a survey at Dalston Holiday Park and residents told them about numerous instances of anti-social and nuisance (particularly excessive noise) activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report added: &#8220;Cumbria police confirmed their stance in that, from a policing perspective, it appears the continued presence of the marquee is having a detrimental effect on the quality of life of residents nearby, for which there is anecdotal evidence.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report to councillors said that while the marquee would continue to support an existing established rural building, its benefits did not outweigh the impact on its neighbours. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gilchrist Collection submitted confidential financial information to the council, but the report to the committee said: &#8220;While this information illustrates that the retention of the marquee would no doubt be beneficial in terms of capacity flexibility for the business, it can be argued not essential as the premises operated successfully before the erection of the marquee.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report concluded: &#8220;The current application lacks any mitigative measures or proposals to combat the objections received.&#8221;</p>\n",

It said: &#8220;This would equate to the removal of the line of spaces along the western boundary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This reduction equates to a 28% reduction in the additional 100 spaces proposed and 15.56% from the total number of proposed spaces. Meaning an overall reduction of 100% of the public or staff spaces.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the November meeting, councillors were concerned about air pollution, nearby residents and wondered about public transport options, which led to the deferment of the decision. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When they meet again on January 8, a planning officers report said since the publication of the original committee report, the National Planning Policy Framework <br>had been updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It now says that to ensure faster delivery of other public service infrastructure, local planning authorities should work proactively and positively with promoters, delivery partners and statutory bodies to plan for required facilities and resolve key planning issues before applications are submitted. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It said significant weight should be placed on the importance of new, expanded or upgraded public service infrastructure when considering proposals for<br>development. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report said: &#8220;The proposal to create a new car park to serve the hospital should, therefore, be given significant weight in the determination of the application.&#8221;</p>\n",

However it has now been designated for homes in the local plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Council planning officers said: &#8220;Overall the proposal offers a compatible and sensitive housing development that makes good use of this premium allocated housing site in a sustainable location that would benefit from and support local services.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Members of Barrow in Furness local area planning committee will discuss the proposals on January 7 at Barrow Town Hall.</p>\n",

Tourists drive for hours to get here on a sunny bank holiday and when they find all the carparks full they resort to parking illegally out of sheer frustration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe issuing of tickets does not prevent this from happening again as the next sunny weekend it is a whole different group of tourists who arrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat is urgently needed is a strong vision and leadership by the authorities responsible for tourism and highways such as the Lake District National Park Authority and Westmorland and Furness Council to invest in park and ride facilities, and other ways to limit the number of cars coming to the area to the number of available parking spaces.\u201d</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"top-10-parking-fine-hotspots-in-westmorland-and-furness-council-area\">Top 10 parking fine hotspots in Westmorland and Furness Council area</h2>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Glebe Road, Bowness 1,165 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Great Dockray, Penrith 791 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Highgate, Kendal, 453 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ferry Road, Barrow Island 441 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stricklandgate, Kendal 432 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ramsden Dock Road, Barrow Island 396 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Compston Road, Ambleside 390</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sandgate, Penrith 349 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stanley Road, Barrow Island 348 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Friargate, Penrith 318</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Cabinet member for highways and ICT for Westmorland and Furness Council councillor Peter Thornton said parking enforcement was a critical part of ensuring streets remain safe and accessible for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: \u201cEffective enforcement helps maintain the flow of traffic, protects access routes, and supports the smooth operation of our communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe council is actively exploring and supporting long-term solutions to address these challenges. This includes working closely with partners such as the Lake District National Park Authority to develop sustainable transport options that will reduce the reliance on cars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe recognise the need for a balanced approach, ensuring adequate legal parking provision while promoting alternatives that support sustainable travel and protect the unique environment of our area and remain committed to working collaboratively with local communities, businesses, and stakeholders to achieve this vision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFor our visitors and residents, we encourage planning journeys in advance, utilising public transport where possible, and being mindful of parking regulations to ensure a positive experience for everyone.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert Allison, team leader of strategy, partnerships and policy for the Lake District National Park Authority, said: \u201cWe recognise the high demand for parking in the Lake District, which is exacerbated during peak visiting seasons in popular locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe want fewer visitors arriving to and moving around the Lake District by private vehicle and to encourage people to park their vehicle for the day and use sustainable travel opportunities if they arrive in a private vehicle, thereby reducing visitor movement pressures and pollution, benefitting the environment and supporting vibrant communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe LDNPA is committed to encouraging sustainable travel and transport including through the Windermere Gateway project by improving the station and its role as a transport interchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTravel within the region remains a key part of the Lake District National Park Partnership\u2019s work and our travel vision is that by 2040 the minimum percentage of visitors arriving by car decreases from the 2015 figure of 83% to 64%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe partnership\u2019s annual report highlights community projects that encourage visitors to travel sustainably and research that demonstrates a clear demand for people to travel without their car on holiday.\u201d</p>\n",

Picture: Google Streetview </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Plans for an adult gaming centre in Barrow could be approved at a council meeting early next month. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Members of Barrow in Furness local area planning committee for Westmorland and Furness Council are recommended to approve the bid by Luxury Leisure to convert the former Shoe Zone on Dalton Road into an Admiral-operated gaming centre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The centre would create 12 jobs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, it wanted to open the centre 24 hours a day but following opposition from Cumbria Constabulary, it now has proposed opening hours of 7am to 2am.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response, Cumbria Constabulary said: \u201cThese revised hours are more proportionate and better align with other premises contributing to the local night time economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe neighbourhood policing team acknowledges and appreciates this support from the applicant, which will assist Cumbria police and our partners in addressing the anti-social behaviour occurring in the area.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luxury Leisure said the centre would generate additional footfall in the town centre with survey data and evidence from other Admiral-operated sites suggesting that visits contribute to the success of other surrounding retailers through linked trips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It added: \u201cThe proposed centre would therefore have positive benefits to the wider town centre through bringing visitors into the town centre who would likely use other local services and facilities.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It said the former Shoe Zone unit had been empty for over a year and the proposed centre would sustain the use of a high street premises that was at risk of long-term vacancy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However the operator of Bailey\u2019s Amusements and Caf\u00e9 on Dalton Road, Barrow, said they believed the business would have to make redundancies if plans are given the go-ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It said there used to be three amusement arcades on Dalton Road in 2007, but two closed down due to lack of business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bailey\u2019s Amusement\u2019s and Caf\u00e9 said it had to cut its opening hours from 9am to 9pm to 9am to 4pm due to lack of footfall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Barrow Town Council also objected to the proposals and warned it believed it would be detrimental to the wellbeing of the town and its residents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luxury Leisure said it had also addressed potential concerns relating to noise from the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plans say sound insulation is used within all premises to shield surrounding occupiers from any noise and any music played within the premises is always at a background level. It said there were no residential properties within a range of the site which could be impacted by noise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plans added: \u201cThis area of the town centre already has a number of late-night activities such as bars and restaurants. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Any noise generation associated with the proposed centre must be seen in this context and, regardless, any noise and disturbance associated with the proposed use would be significantly less than that associated with other evening economy type uses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAdmiral units do not serve alcohol, nor do they allow the consumption of alcohol on-site. This helps to mitigate the potential for anti-social behaviour and thus further prevent adverse impacts on residential amenity.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Members of Barrow in Furness local area planning committee are recommended to approve the plans when they meet on January 7 at Barrow Town Hall.</p>\n",

It has been mentioned on Cumbria Crack&#8230;</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, while they may want you to think that this is about having a more sustainable model for waste services and recycling, let us be very clear that this is, first and foremost, about saving money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is made quite clear in the council executive minutes of their meeting on November 26, when it says: \u201cThe Sustainable, Resilient, and Connected Places Portfolio Holder reported that the recommended operating and delivery model was expected to deliver a substantial reduction against the current revenue costs, generate income revenue, and sought to address the future anticipated transformation savings.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What it doesn\u2019t spell out, certainly in the bits of this that are in the public domain, is exactly how those savings are to be achieved. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this payback time for Allerdale-based bin collectors who defied them last summer? While the reason for holding back key information is mired in gobbledygook, this cat will bet it is because Allerdale bin emptying is still managed by an arm\u2019s length company and this is a useful excuse for not mentioning any of the financial matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest \u2013 changes from boxes to bins in Carlisle (that will go down well in those areas with terraced houses) charging \u00a340 for an additional garden waste bin or reducing black bin collections from weekly to fortnightly, will depend entirely on the make up of each household as one size does not fit all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One area they appear to have overlooked, is kitchen waste. Just think of all those brussels sprout or potato trimmings, or, heaven forbid, the left over turkey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Cumberland Council, everyone, should be making their own compost (again, think terraced housing) and, if not, this waste has to go into the black, general, waste bin where it will start to smell pretty quickly especially in summer while householders wait for their fortnightly bin collections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will also attract vermin and if you think I am responsible for sorting out the rats in the neighbourhood, you are mistaken &#8211; I am far too good looking for that!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, it appears the decision to go ahead has already been taken. Yes, at the meeting of the council executive on November 26, the meeting decided to go ahead regardless of the \u2018informal\u2019 public consultation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it appears that what you say in their little survey, will have no impact whatsoever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, here is the feline take on Cumberland Council\u2019s proposals:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>This is, primarily, about saving money which will include job losses.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>They deliberately selected the Christmas period for the consultation because it lowers response rates</li>\n\n\n\n<li>With fortnightly collections, especially in summer, kitchen waste will need to be managed by the householder to minimise smells and vermin.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Woe betides anyone living in a terraced house in Carlisle, Workington, Maryport or Whitehaven who leaves their wheelie bin on the street!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By all means complete their little survey before January 8 and tell them what you think and a very happy new year from The Cat.</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"about-cumbria-cat\">About Cumbria Cat</h2>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Uppies-and-Downies-April-2023-11-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-122711\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Uppies-and-Downies-April-2023-11-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Uppies-and-Downies-April-2023-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Uppies-and-Downies-April-2023-11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Uppies-and-Downies-April-2023-11-750x500.jpg 750w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Uppies-and-Downies-April-2023-11-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Uppies-and-Downies-April-2023-11.jpg 1204w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Born in Cumberland and back living in Cumberland, having spent most of the past 50 years in some place called Cumbria, this cat has used up all nine lives as well as a few others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always happy to curl up on a friendly lap, the preference is for a local lap and not a lap that wants to descend on the county to change it into something it isn\u2019t. After all, you might think Cumbria/Cumberland/Westmorland is a land forged by nature \u2013 the glaciers, the rivers, breaking down the volcanic rocks or the sedimentary layers \u2013 but, in reality, the Cumbria we know today was forged by generations of local people, farmers, miners, quarriers, and foresters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This cat is a local moggy, not a Burmese, Ocicat or Persian, and although I have been around the block a few times, whenever I jump, I end up on my feet back in my home county. I am passionate about the area, its people, past, present and future, and those who come to admire what we hold dear, be it lakes and mountains, wild sea shores, vibrant communities or the history as rich and diverse as anywhere in the world.</p>\n",

The frequency of these refuse and recycling collections will not change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is proposed to provide wheeled bins from May 2026.</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"garden-waste-in-the-former-allerdale-and-carlisle-areas\">Garden waste in the former Allerdale and Carlisle areas</h2>\n\n\n<p>It is proposed to collect and dispose of garden waste from one bin per property. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be a yearly charge of \u00a340 per additional bin that residents request to be collected. This is consistent with the approach in the former Copeland area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is proposed to make this change in March 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collections will be fortnightly between March and November each year (Carlisle is currently all year but with a reduced service December-February).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the former Copeland area, the current arrangements will continue as normal, and no changes are proposed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cumberland.gov.uk/your-council/have-your-say\">The consultation document is available at&nbsp;www.cumberland.gov.uk/have-your-say&nbsp;</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paper copies are available at libraries across the Cumberland area, as well as at Allerdale House in Workington, Cumbria House, and the Civic Centre in Carlisle or the Market Hall in Whitehaven.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The authority said the proposed changes would:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Harmonise waste collections throughout Cumberland\u2019s area.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enhance service reliability and efficiency.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create a positive working environment for staff.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Support Cumberland Council\u2019s environmental goals and compliance with new government regulations.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Maximising contributions to these products can help investors manage their tax liabilities more effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst advice to complete an annual transfer from your GIA to your ISA or pension continues to stand true, it could be that the transferable amount is now limited or completed over a longer period of time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Annual market performance has seen a dip over the last couple of years, but as we continue to a recovery, gains on holdings are increasing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Effectively, this time last year it is likely that your fund value was lower, and the CGT exemption was higher, whereas this year the value is higher, and the exemption is lower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reduced CGT exemption may also influence your investment decisions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might become more cautious about realising gains, opting instead to hold onto investments for longer periods, or as a legacy investment to leave to your loved ones in the event of your death. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may, of course, be possible that some of your funds have lost value, these holdings can be sold and used to offset gains from other funds. This can be helpful and will offer slightly increased flexibility when calculating the overall gains.</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"is-it-worth-paying-an-increase-cgt-liability\">Is it worth paying an increase CGT liability?</h2>\n\n\n<p>There will be times when it makes sense to realise a gain and pay the tax, but it doesn\u2019t have to be negative, as any gain is a sign the portfolio has performed well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Realising a gain will allow you to consider the possibility of a new environment, the funds may remain in a GIA, but as mentioned, other options include ISAs, pensions and onshore or offshore bonds where suitable. It may be worth considering a CGT budget, where some of the fund is sold rather than all of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, an individual has held capital in a GIA since the early 2000s, with an accrued value of \u00a3150,000. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This represents the majority of their investment portfolio, and having never moved any of this money to a tax-free environment, their gains are now in the region of \u00a360,000. Inclusive of the \u00a33,000 CGT exemption allowance, the CGT tax bill (taxed at the higher 24% rate) will be \u00a313,680.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a case like this, good financial planning will always be to avoid letting the \u2018tax tail wag the dog\u2019 and consider moving the capital to a new environment in order to mitigate the risk of being overweight in a taxable environment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Selling the investment can allow for more effective management and increase the opportunity to meet long term goals and objectives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the complexities introduced by the above changes, seeking professional financial advice is more important than ever.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"please-get-in-touch-to-speak-to-speak-to-a-member-of-our-financial-planning-team-call-01768-222030\">Please get in touch to speak to speak to a member of our financial planning team.

At least the fog and rain of previous weeks was absent. Indeed, it was unseasonably warm with a gentle breeze.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was still some apprehension as to how many would turn up on the day. However, by 8.30am any concerns we had were put to rest by the steady stream of cars entering Frenchfield. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As people began to gather outside the pavilion a really good atmosphere was developing with everyone clearly out to enjoy themselves many of them in various Christmas related fancy dress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By 10am, 319 people had crossed the line of whom 43 were first timers and 33 recorded new personal bests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First across the line was Harry Lancaster of Eden Runners. Emma Stuart was the first female in a personal best. Two Penrith parkrun regulars achieved personal milestones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roy Bottomley completed his 200th run and David Spence, one of our regular pacers completed 100 runs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A full list of participants, results and volunteers can be found at <a href=\"https://www.parkrun.org.uk/penrith/results/latestresults/\">www.parkrun.org.uk/penrith/results/latestresults/</a></p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"report-david-robertson\">Report: David Robertson</h4>",

Mason Partners will manage the site on a day-to-day basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The council said it was currently exploring options to improve the hall&#8217;s experience and offer, including a potential communal seating area to help attract more people to eat and shop there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Market Hall is Grade II listed and an application for listed building consent has been submitted to gain in-principal approval for works that would affect the historic fabric.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some concept designs for a communal seating area were included in the application to provide some context, the council said, but the designs would need to be developed further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Councillor Barbara Cannon, executive member for financial planning and assets, said: \u201cThese recent developments at the Market Hall are really positive news for Carlisle and the wider Cumberland area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We look forward to working with Bearmont, the new managing agents and existing traders and stallholders to develop the site and help it reach its full potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe Market Hall presents a huge opportunity to create an exciting destination for residents and visitors that would contribute to the vitality and sustainability of Carlisle city centre. It\u2019s been a much-loved part of the city\u2019s retail offer for generations and we\u2019re excited to see what the future holds.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Lloyd, CEO of Bearmont Group, said: \u201cThe Market Hall represents the heart of Carlisle\u2019s retail experience, and we see a tremendous opportunity to bring new energy to this historic site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is part of our strategic approach &#8211; identifying shopping centres that have lost their way and giving them a new lease on life. We\u2019ll be working closely with Cumberland Council to breathe new life into the indoor market, with an emphasis on introducing more local artisan businesses and an expanded food offering. We\u2019ve already received interest from prospective tenants for the former Wilko site, and we hope to announce further developments shortly.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr Lloyd said Bearmont\u2019s focus was on supporting local retail and driving foot traffic by blending traditional retail with fresh, modern offerings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: \u201cMarkets today need to inspire people to visit; we\u2019re looking at introducing more artisan vendors, like butchers, fishmongers, and bakers, to restore that personal, vibrant atmosphere where shoppers can enjoy unique, quality goods and genuine interactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are keen to welcome smaller local businesses that require flexible, cost-effective space. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As a private company, we can make quick decisions &#8211; often within a day or two &#8211; allowing us to respond rapidly to the needs of our tenants, especially independent retailers.\u201d</p>\n",

The space on offer at the site means the animals will have greater access to enjoy their surroundings which is part of the applicant\u2019s focus on animal welfare.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the management plan submitted with the application, the maximum number of spaces available to stay in the onsite accommodation at any one time will be 38 guests over nine separate accommodation units.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would allow for a maximum number of day visitors of 41 guests; however plans state the booking system would operate by having available spaces to book onto an encounter which could all be filled by holiday accommodation guests and therefore the actual number of day visitors is expected to be less than this number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The planning statement said: \u201cThe visitor attraction would not operate as a zoo and access would be strictly limited through the pre-booking system and guests staying in the holiday accommodation.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This planning application is under consideration.</p>\n",

Nic Bollado\u2019s firm shot was pushed away by Alex Mitchell then, in the 43rd minute, the Highwaymen opened the scoring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will Dowling scored at the second attempt, after Mitchell parried his original shot, so, from being second best, Town suddenly had something to defend and Workington were visibly shaken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having started the game on the front foot, Reds struggled to get going on the restart and it took a wonderful solo dribble from the outstanding Grewal to re-ignite their fire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mid-way through the second period, the champagne moment arrived. David Symington delivered the perfect corner and Ambrose timed his run perfectly to meet the ball and thump home a wonderful header.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His first goal for the club was celebrated with his trademark double somersault and the bumper Boxing Day crowd sensed that would be the turning point of the game. Or would it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morpeth dampened home spirits again and Luke James restored their narrow advantage with a goal after 72 minutes.

Both casualties were handed to the ambulance service and the premises made safe.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Officers stopped and breathalysed around 20 drivers and no one was found to be over the limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the weekend, officers also carried out some engagement with licensed premises in Workington town centre. No issues were reported.<br><br>In Whitehaven, Neighbourhood Policing Teams carried out shoplifting patrols and licensed premises were visited across the weekend.<br><br>Across the rest of the county, officers worked alongside response colleagues in the county\u2019s main nightlife areas and carried out high visibility patrols to offer support and reassurance and to act as a deterrent against crime and anti-social behaviour.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chief Inspector Nat Jukes&nbsp;said: \u201cWe want people to have fun this Christmas and enjoy their nights out safely and because of this, it is important that we plan for the potential demand increase in popular nightlife areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe placement of Safer Street Welfare Hubs in Carlisle and Bowness-on-Windermere means the emergency services are all working together in the same place, helping people at some of the busiest times of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOperation Enhance also continues throughout the festive period and the public can expect to continue to see additional officers patrolling hotspot areas for anti-social behaviour and violence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe hope that our presence in these areas and proactive work will assist those who need us on a night out, as well as acting as a deterrent to anyone thinking about committing any kind of crime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPlease enjoy yourself and have fun on your nights out. If you do find yourself in difficulty, remember we have officers and staff on hand to provide assistance.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cumbria\u2019s Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner, David Allen, said: \u201cWe know that having a visible police presence brings comfort to those out having a good time and that it deters criminals from committing offences. The police and other agencies are out there to help and assist anyone needing help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe police are out on our streets every single day of the year but this does increase during our busy periods \u2013 such as Christmas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur Welfare Hubs are a fantastic resource and I would encourage anyone feeling uncomfortable or needing help to approach the volunteers \u2013 these safe spaces are a hub for anyone needing support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI hope the public feel reassured seeing officers on their streets and that they enjoy their celebrations over the festive period.\u201d</p>\n",

The operation aims to prevent and disrupt serious and organised rural acquisitive crime that occurs in our county.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The operation sees officers from multiple departments working together such as officers from Neighbourhood Policing, Roads Policing Unit, CID, Dog Section and more work together to tackle the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This work has resulted in multiple arrests in connection to rural crime with many leading to conviction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team said this included: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Jamie Cliff, 30, of Melrose Drive, St Helen Auckland, was sentenced on September 26 2024 after he pleaded guilty to two police assaults and driving while disqualified. He received an eight-month custodial sentence and was further disqualified from driving for 48 months.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Michael Broomfield, 38, of Cheviot Walk, Coundon, Bishop Auckland, was sentenced on October 18 for burglary and was sentenced to six months in prison.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Thomas Price, 60, of Redway Road, Cardiff, with theft and breach of a criminal behaviour order. He was sentenced to two years and two months.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The team also worked with the RSPCA and secured the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Reece Robertson, 26, Cook Road, Millom, on April 29 was sentenced at South Cumbria Magistrates\u2019 Court, having pleaded guilty to four offences under the Animal Welfare Act 2006. Robertson was banned from keeping animals for 10 years, given a 12-month community order which requires him to complete 200 hours of unpaid work.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Peter Bewsher, 35, of Greendykes, Egremont, was in court on November 6 following a warrant conducted in 2024 after three dogs were rescued by the RSPCA as part of an investigation into wildlife offences. He was given a suspended sentence and disqualified from keeping dogs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Cumbria\u2019s Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner David Allen, said: \u201cCumbria is an incredibly rural county so it\u2019s vital that we have dedicated resources to combat rural crime and provide safety advice to businesses and residents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cA 44% drop in quad bike thefts is no small feat and highlights just how dedicated the Rural Crime Team \u2013 and all police \u2013 are to combatting crime and keeping the county safe.&#8221;</p>\n",

What will you be doing over the festive period apart from stuffing your face and polishing off the understairs wine cupboard\u201d.&nbsp; \u201cIf you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll spend a night on the cold, frosty tile\u2026\u2026\u201d.&nbsp; \u201cOkay then!\u201d) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wish you all a very furry Christmas and a joyous, cattastic 2025.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope to see you all, on the page of course, on the other side.&nbsp; Purr Purr Purr.</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"about-cumbria-cat\">About Cumbria Cat</h2>\n\n\n<p>Born in Cumberland and back living in Cumberland, having spent most of the past 50 years in some place called Cumbria, this cat has used up all nine lives as well as a few others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always happy to curl up on a friendly lap, the preference is for a local lap and not a lap that wants to descend on the county to change it into something it isn\u2019t. After all, you might think Cumbria/Cumberland/Westmorland is a land forged by nature \u2013 the glaciers, the rivers, breaking down the volcanic rocks or the sedimentary layers \u2013 but, in reality, the Cumbria we know today was forged by generations of local people, farmers, miners, quarriers, and foresters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This cat is a local moggy, not a Burmese, Ocicat or Persian, and although I have been around the block a few times, whenever I jump, I end up on my feet back in my home county. I am passionate about the area, its people, past, present and future, and those who come to admire what we hold dear, be it lakes and mountains, wild sea shores, vibrant communities or the history as rich and diverse as anywhere in the world.</p>\n",

But after deliberating for just over 12 hours, a jury of seven men and five women did find Mounsey guilty of two alternative, lesser charges \u2014 those of wounding Mr Bennett and the child with intent to cause grievous bodily harm \u2014 on majority verdicts of 10 to two, and 11 to one, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During evidence, jurors heard how Mounsey stabbed 56-year-old Mr Bennett as he lay sleeping on a living room sofa inside the address at Whernside on June 10.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr Bennett felt a jab and heard what he described as a crunch from his neck before seeing Mounsey with the knife and realising what had happened, Carlisle Crown Court heard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As he tried to flee the house, bleeding, and reached the garden steps, Mounsey grabbed and jumped on to him before attempting to stab him again. \u201cI was just trying to get out; just trying to run for my life,\u201d Mr Bennett told a jury.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the immediate aftermath, Mr Bennett had told neighbours of her attack on him: \u201cJackie has stabbed us\u201d.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the incident, Mounsey also stabbed a child to both sides of the neck. A pathologist viewed a CT scan which showed the wounds were very close to penetrating the internal jugular vein. The expert estimated the youngster may have been potentially millimetres from losing their life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Mr Bennett and the child were treated in hospital before later being discharged. Mounsey also suffered injuries which the pathologist suggested could be tentative or hesitant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A neighbour who saw Mounsey and the child bleeding from neck wounds \u00a0spoke of something like a scene from a horror movie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis is a difficult and tragic case,\u201d prosecutor Iain Simkin KC had told jurors as he opened the case against Mounsey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prosecutor suggested Mounsey had gone on to stab herself after attacking Mr Bennett and the child, adding: \u201cWhat is without doubt members of the jury, is that all three of them were very lucky to survive.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jurors watched video footage captured by two detectives at a bail address after she had been interviewed and gave mostly no comment answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During long exchanges, she hinted at wanting to tell the officers something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat I\u2019ve got to say is going to get me into trouble,\u201d she initially said. \u201cI want to tell you but I don\u2019t want jail.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI just want to confess now,\u201d she continued. \u201cI did it.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giving evidence, Mounsey said she remembered nothing from June 10, nor making the subsequent, telling comments to police. She spoke of being devastated by the earlier death of her mother, which had brought other past trauma firmly into focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mounsey showed no emotion as the four verdicts were returned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judge Nicholas Barker said he would not pass sentence immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He instead adjourned the case until February 7, ordering the preparation of a probation service report following an assessment of Mounsey; and impact statements on behalf of Mr Bennett and the child.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou have heard the jury\u2019s verdicts on you in respect of these two very serious charges of wounding with intent,\u201d said Judge Barker to Mounsey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI have called for reports and statements to be obtained to assist me with the sentence. I simply say this, which is something you will be aware of: the only sentence the court can give you, certainly at this stage, is a sentence of immediate custody. That will be of some duration. Beyond that I will say nothing further.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mounsey, previously of Whernside, remains remanded in custody.</p>\n",

People using them can be at a high risk of unintentional overdose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buying drugs illegally also means there are no guarantees what these may actually contain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This issue is being covered under Cumbria Constabulary\u2019s ongoing Operation Level, the force said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Detective Inspector David Howard said: \u201cBuying anything online without knowing the source or seller is dangerous and risky \u2013 you don\u2019t know what you will get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCertainly, pills and medication normally prescribed by a&nbsp;suitably qualified health professionals such as a GP&nbsp;should never be bought online without a properly conducted consultation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFake and dangerous pills are sold online without any regulations or care for the end user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPills and medications such as this should be prescribed by a&nbsp;suitably qualified health professionals, such as a GP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf you suffer any adverse reaction from taking a drug bought online, seek medical help straight away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere is also help and support out there for people affected by drug use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe need our communities to tell us about prescription drug supply in your area and would encourage anyone who suspects any illegal activity to report to us so that we can investigate.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police are appealing for anyone with information about such sales of prescription drugs to come forward with information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone with information about drugs supply is asked to contact police on 101&nbsp;or report online at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cumbria.police.uk/reportit\">www.cumbria.police.uk/report-it</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, call the independent charity Crimestoppers, completely anonymously, on 0800 555 111.</p>\n",

It&#8217;s quite gory in parts and features some great practical effects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For fans of Christmas Horror, this film offers a good dose of entertainment. One thing to keep your eyes peeled for while watching is the nods it gives to John Carpenter&#8217;s Halloween and The Fog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s always fun to catch those subtle references in films and shows that the Directors having fun with the concept. However, it&#8217;s important to note that if you&#8217;re easily offended, this film might not be for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a significant amount of blackface present, which can be uncomfortable for some viewers, but it\u2019s just their customs and folklore. It doesn&#8217;t hold back when it comes to jump scares and the body count.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout, providing some decent little scares. For those interested in watching it, Saint is available on Amazon Prime Video, but it is the subtitled version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, I personally enjoy the the film it\u2019s great fun. It\u2019s a great fun-filled Christmas horror film that I&#8217;ve been enjoying for the past 13 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With its unique blend of Dutch folklore and slasher elements, it offers a thrilling and entertaining experience. Just be prepared for the gore, jump scares, and the presence of blackface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rated: 18</strong></p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rare-exports-2010\">RARE EXPORTS.(2010)</h2>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"jeg_video_container jeg_video_content\"><iframe title=\"Rare Exports : A Christmas Tale | trailer #1 US (2010)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PwT3wtUCv9Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1401143/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a>Next up we have the 2010 Christmas horror film Rare Exports this can also be found on Amazon Prime, written and directed by Jalmari Helander and starring the talented father and son acting team of Jorma and Onni Tommila, among others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This film is a cracker and it delves into the darker side of Santa Claus, showcasing a unique take on the myth and legends surrounding the jolly old man.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having previously watched the short films that inspired the full-length feature, I was thrilled to see the story expanded on the big screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was also my introduction to the on-screen chemistry between Jorma and Onni Tommila, who would later star together in other films by the same director, such as Big Game and Sisu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a cracking Christmas horror film that perfectly balances fun and fright. I have made it a tradition to watch this film every year since its release, as it never fails to entertain with its great story and engaging characters. The pacing is spot-on, ensuring that the film doesn&#8217;t overstay its welcome and keeps you hooked from start to finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the film&#8217;s strongest aspects is its visuals, which enhance the fantastic story being told. The last 20 minutes of the film are particularly thrilling, reminiscent of&nbsp;&nbsp;Night of the Living Dead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of zombies, we are treated to killer feral Santa&#8217;s Elves, with a frozen Kaiju Santa thrown into the mix. Young Pietari, the film&#8217;s protagonist, takes charge and leads the adults in a mission to combat this unexpected threat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a joy to watch as the young boy&#8217;s plan unfolds and he stops the threat and saves his father\u2019s Business in the process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s&nbsp;&nbsp;a delightfully twisted Christmas horror film that offers a fresh take on the Santa Claus mythology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With its well-paced storytelling, and the standout performances of the Tommila duo, this film is a must-watch for fans of Christmas horror. It&#8217;s a great blend of fun and fright, making it a perfect choice for those seeking a unique and thrilling holiday movie.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rating: 15</strong></p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"santas-slay-2005\">SANTA\u2019S SLAY.(2005)</h2>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"jeg_video_container jeg_video_content\"><iframe title=\"Santa&#039;s Slay (2005) - Trailer\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XfU78A-x0xc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0393685/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2005 Christmas comedy horror film &#8220;Santa&#8217;s Slay,&#8221; written and directed by David Steiman and starring an ensemble cast including Douglas Smith, Emilia De Ravin, Robert Culp, and Bill Goldberg as Santa Claus himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This film kicks off with a dysfunctional family gathering for dinner, only to have their festivities interrupted by a Santa Claus who brings a whole new meaning to the phrase naughty or nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the very beginning, Santa&#8217;s Slay sets the tone with a delightfully gory and fun opening scene. The dysfunctional family, played by talented actors like Rebecca Gayheart, Chris Kattan, Fran Drescher, and James Caan, are dispatched by Santa in various creative and Christmas-themed ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a fantastic introduction that prepares the audience for what\u2019s ahead. One thing about this film is it doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. With its tongue firmly in its cheek, the film embraces its absurd premise and delivers a fun and entertaining festive fright fest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the perfect choice for those looking for a Christmas film that deviates from the traditional and embraces the darker side of the holiday but is still so much fun. Another thing I liked was all the cameo appearances by various actors, adding to the festive fun factor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The strip club scene is a cracking moment, as Santa goes for a lap dance and takes out unsuspecting patrons with a mix of goofiness and festive violence. The juxtaposition of the cheerful Christmas music playing in the background adds an extra layer of comedic effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I particularly enjoyed the Rankin/Bass style animation used to tell the backstory of why Santa turned evil. It adds a nice throwback visual element to the film and provides a fun twist on the traditional Santa Claus story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clocking in at a well-paced 1 hour and 18 minutes, Santa&#8217;s Slay keeps the momentum going as Santa unleashes havoc on the townspeople. While some of the early 2000s CGI may appear dated, it adds to the charm and overall campiness of the film.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The practical effects are a highlight, showcasing some fun and gruesome visuals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those interested, Santa&#8217;s Slay is available for free on YouTube . It&#8217;s a film that I have revisited every year since its release, as it never fails to deliver good, silly fun. Don&#8217;t forget to stick around for the end credits for an additional sequence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a fun twisted Christmas comedy horror that takes the concept of Santa Claus and turns it on its head. With its dark humor, memorable kills, and an ensemble cast that embraces the absurdity of the story, this film is a must-watch for those seeking a fun and unconventional holiday movie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rating: 15</strong></p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"better-watch-out-2016\">BETTER WATCH OUT (2016) </h2>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"jeg_video_container jeg_video_content\"><iframe title=\"Better Watch Out Trailer 1 (2017) | Movieclips Indie\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1BDxAsaoM1Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one you would have to pick up on disc at the moment, Better Watch Out, written and directed by Chris Peckover, is a Christmas horror film that takes a refreshing and twisted approach to Baby sitter slasher films.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starring Olivia Dejonge, Levi Miller, Ed Oxenbould, Patrick Warburton, and Virginia Madsen, the film combines comedy, suspense, and unexpected twists to deliver a truly entertaining festive horror.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The film follows the story of Ashley, a teenage babysitter, tasked with looking after 12-year-old Luke Lerner during the holiday season. What starts as an innocent night of babysitting takes a dark turn when Luke&#8217;s romantic feelings for Ashley lead to a series of unsettling events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The film cleverly plays with the usual babysitter slasher film tropes, only to flip them on their head, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats and thoroughly entertained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really liked its dark sense of humour, which runs consistently throughout. From the witty and hilarious banter between the parents at the beginning to the unexpected twists and turns, Better Watch Out keeps you engaged with its cleverly crafted comedic moments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cast, including the talented Olivia Dejonge, Levi Miller, and the rest of the ensemble, deliver excellent performances throughout. What sets it apart is its ability to go where you least expect it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just when you think you have it figured out, the film takes a sharp turn, leaving you pleasantly surprised. The pacing is relentless, and once the action starts, there&#8217;s no let-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The film incorporates a few Home Alone references, which is a nice touch. Levi Miller shines in his portrayal of Luke, capturing the character&#8217;s manipulative and disturbed nature with chilling precision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His performance is captivating, and it&#8217;s evident that he had a blast embodying the twisted mind of Luke. It\u2019s a dark and twisted Christmas horror film that doesn&#8217;t hold back. With its great sense of humor, decent cast, and unexpected plot twists, it&#8217;s a must-watch for fans of Christmas Horror.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The film keeps you guessing, laughing, and cringing in equal measure, making for an absolute Christmas cracker of a movie. It\u2019s a delightful and wickedly entertaining film that will leave you thoroughly entertained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen it yet, I highly recommend checking it out. Just be prepared for a wild and darkly humorous ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rating: 15</strong></p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"christmas-bloody-christmas-2022\">CHRISTMAS BLOODY CHRISTMAS.(2022)</h2>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"jeg_video_container jeg_video_content\"><iframe title=\"Christmas Bloody Christmas - Official Trailer [HD] | A Shudder Original\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fjLFSDCMuBM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This one is available to stream on Amazon Prime via Shudder. Christmas Bloody Christmas, written and directed by Joe Begos, is a fun and gory Christmas horror film that combines elements of Silent Night, Deadly Night and The Terminator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starring Riley Dandy, Sam Delich, Jonah Ray, Dora Madison, and Abraham Benrubi as the axe-wielding Robo-Santa, the film delivers a neon-drenched, blood-soaked Christmas frenzy that is sure to satisfy fans of alternative holiday films.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The film kicks off with hilarious fake advertisements that set the tone for the film that follows. These ads reminded me of the memorable commercials from Robocop, adding a touch of nostalgic humor to the proceedings. Joe Begos&#8217; signature neon-drenched visual style is on full display, some folk hate it but I don\u2019t mind it here as it\u2019s as if everything is lit with Christmas lights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing to note is the abundance of profanity in the dialogue. If you&#8217;re not a fan of Swearing, be warned that every other word seems to be a Swear, it didn&#8217;t bother me, but it may bother for some folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abraham Benrubi&#8217;s portrayal of the axe-wielding Robo-Santa is a standout. Fans of the TV show ER will recognize Benrubi from his role as the kind-hearted Jerry Markovic. Seeing him take on the role of a Terminator-like killing machine adds an unexpected and fun bit of trivia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s&nbsp;&nbsp;an absolute blast from start to finish. It combines elements of classic Christmas horror films with the relentless action of The Terminator, resulting in a chaotic and mayhem-filled Christmas cracker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the film may not be perfect, its imperfections can be easily forgiven due to the sheer entertainment value it provides. The film&#8217;s eclectic soundtrack also adds to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a mix of rock-based tracks and Carpenter/Fiedel-esque synth wave, the music helps with the atmosphere and perfectly complements the on-screen chaos. The blood flows and heads explode as the body count rises, satisfying gore enthusiasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The practical effects are top-notch, adding an authentic and visceral quality to the film&#8217;s gruesome moments.

With its throwback vibe, great practical effects, and an eclectic soundtrack, it&#8217;s a must-watch for fans of alternative Christmas films.

Directed by Magnus Marten, There&#8217;s Something In The Barn is a Christmas comedy horror that delivers a fantastic blend of laughs and gore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starring Martin Starr, Amrita Acharia, and introducing the talented Townes Bunner in his screen acting debut, this film takes viewers on a wild and mischievous ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the moment I caught the trailer for There&#8217;s Something In The Barn a few months ago, I knew it would be a great fun watch. Not only does it feature the talented Martin Starr in a starring role, but he also serves as a producer, adding his comedic touch to the film.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starr has consistently impressed with his performances in some funny films over the years, and it&#8217;s always a pleasure to see him on screen. One of the highlights of the film is the design of the barn elves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They resemble dirty little Santas, adding a visually appealing element to the story. Their mischievous nature is a constant source of entertainment, leading to gruesome consequences for the unsuspecting family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The film is packed with proper Christmas tunes like &#8220;Sleigh Ride,&#8221; &#8220;Jingle Bell Rock,&#8221; and &#8220;Holly Jolly Christmas,&#8221; which enhance the festive atmosphere and immerse viewers in the holiday spirit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The family dynamics in There&#8217;s Something In The Barn are quite disjointed, and as the mischievous elf unleashes havoc, the fractures within the family become more pronounced. It starts off slowly, introducing us to the family and the barn elf, as Lucas, the son, tries to follow the three important Barn Elf Rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the family dismisses the existence of barn elves, leading to a Night of the Living Dead-style chaos when an army of elves descends upon them. The film delivers great gory fun, with great splatter and practical effects used for the elves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mischievousness of the elves brings to mind the classic Gremlins (1984), with their rule-breaking antics and their indulgence in booze and partying amidst the carnage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My only gripe is it could have been slightly shorter, losing about ten minutes to maintain a tighter pace, it remains a solid entry into the pantheon of Christmas horror films.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The film is so much fun that I would gladly watch it again, as it successfully combines humor and gore, culminating in a touch of Christmas sentiment at the end. It\u2019s a funny and blood splattered Christmas comedy horror that delivers on its promise of laughs and thrills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Martin Starr&#8217;s cracking performance, memorable practical effects, and a mischievous army of barn elves, this film is a must-watch for fans of the genre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite a slight pacing issue, the film&#8217;s ability to balance humour and horror makes it a delightful addition to the Christmas horror canon. Get ready for a wild and festive ride with There&#8217;s Something In The Barn!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rating: 15</strong></p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"its-a-wonderful-knife-2023\">IT\u2019S A WONDERFUL KNIFE (2023)</h2>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"jeg_video_container jeg_video_content\"><iframe title=\"IT&#039;S A WONDERFUL KNIFE Official Trailer (2023)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VsKLKriMch4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27619382/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk\"></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another that you can find on Amazon Prime via Shudder. Directed by Tyler McIntyre, It&#8217;s a Wonderful Knife is a cracking spin on the classic 1946 Christmas film It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starring Jane Widdop, Joel McHale, Justin Long, Kathrine Isabelle, and the cigarette smoking man himself William B. Davies, this Christmas slasher/fantasy film offers a delightful and gory treat for horror fans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this twisted tale, Winnie Carruthers, the town savior of Angel Falls, finds herself transported to an alternate universe after wishing she had never been born. In this new reality, the psychotic killer she once vanquished returns to unleash terror once more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the highlights of It&#8217;s a Wonderful Knife lies in its cracking cast. With talents like Justin Long, who never fails to deliver, the film delivers a belter performance from him as he embraces the role with gusto, complete with some crazy dental work that makes his teeth appear massive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Penned by the same writers as the cracking slasher film with a twist, Freaky, It showcases the same creativity and mastery of the genre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The film takes inspiration from Scream, slightly adopting the look and actions of the killer, while also featuring some fantastic practical gore effects and bloody kills that us horror fans will relish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While It may not be perfect, it is undeniably a great, fun watch. As a fan of Christmas horror films, I couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better way to kick off the festive season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The film keeps you engaged throughout and delivers some unexpected twists that add to the film and I wasn\u2019t expecting.The twist within the twist in it is a stroke of brilliance, leaving me pleasantly surprised as I didn\u2019t see it coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, this film was an excellent start to my festive fright films. It combined the joyous spirit of the holiday season with the bloody elements of a slasher film, creating a unique blend of genres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a festive slasher delight that offers a fresh twist on a beloved Christmas film.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a cracking cast, fantastic practical effects, and unexpected twists, it delivers a cracking and enjoyable film. As a fan of the genre, I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this film and highly recommend it to fellow horror fans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rating: 18</strong></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"726\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/paul-one-1024x726.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-335091\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/paul-one-1024x726.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/paul-one-300x213.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/paul-one-768x545.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/paul-one-206x146.jpg 206w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/paul-one-120x86.jpg 120w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/paul-one.jpg 1170w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Picture: Paul Donaldson</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/carlislecultcinemaclub\"><strong>You can keep up with screenings and the club&#8217;s latest news here.</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thecarlislecultcinemacast.buzzsprout.com\"><strong>To listen to the Carlisle Cult Cinema Cast, click here.</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtube.com/@carlislecultcinemaclub?si=B10gLSYtYWMsDZfm\"><strong>To watch the Carlisle Cult Cinema Cast on YouTube, click here.</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also listen to Paul&#8217;s radio show on CRFM 102.7, where he plays tunes from movies, TV shows and adverts every Monday from 10pm until midnight.</p>\n",

He is also dedicating major fundraising efforts next year to support Hospice at Home, Eden Valley Hospice, and Pancreatic Cancer Action in memory of his father.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Debbie McKenna, CEO of Hospice at Home Carlisle and North Lakeland, said: \u201cWe are thrilled to welcome Ian as our new charity ambassador. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;His enthusiasm, extensive network, and deep understanding of the importance of our services will be invaluable as we strive to reach more people and secure vital funding. Ian\u2019s personal connection to Hospice at Home adds a heartfelt layer to his advocacy, and we are excited about the impact he will have.\u201d</p>\n",

Reds had blocked two attempts in quick succession but couldn\u2019t prevent a firm low strike from finding the bottom left-hand corner of Mitchell\u2019s net.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reds won their first corner soon after the restart but Aiden Dowling dealt with the cross unchallenged. But, from their next flag kick, Jordan Little saw his goal-bound header tipped over the bar by the City keeper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the hosts got forward in their next attack, Charlie Bailey squandered a good opportunity when it looked easier to score.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reds restored parity after seventy-two minutes with a well worked goal. The ball was switched from left to right with Galloway making ground before delivering a decent cross into the area and top scorer Rigg finished confidently in front of the large travelling away support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Mitchell was next called upon, he made a fine save to deny Mansell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Workington seemed to have the momentum and were encouraged to push on for the winner by the hordes backing the West Cumbrians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when Kai Nugent delivered a pin-point cross from the left, it should have been the match-winning moment. It fell to Dav Symington, making a welcome return to the team after a 10-game absence, but the substitute couldn\u2019t keep his effort under the bar, and the chance was gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fell, was pleased with the team\u2019s commitment. He said: \u201cIt was another goal for Riggy, a good point on the road and has given us a good platform to go into the Boxing Day game with confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur support today was incredible and they got us back in the game. Hopefully, they will come in their numbers for the Morpeth Town match and help us get over 1,000 people through the turnstiles.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Workington host Morpeth Town on Boxing Day and travel to Hebburn Town on New Year\u2019s Day, both games kick off at 3pm.</p>\n",

They were forced to dig deep into squad resources to field a team for this tough visit to North East High Flyers, Morpeth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The forwards were in reasonable shape bolstered by James Dowling coming in for his first game of the season and Phil Dixon emerging from retirement to help out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The back division suffered the most disruption with veteran playmaker Steven Stoddart answering the call alongside another \u2018retiree\u2019 in the shape of centre Heinie Jonker. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Short of a right winger, Lewis Barwise normally a backrow volunteered for the role. On the bench, there were two new faces in Jonny Miller and Connor Sinkinson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so Aspatria began the game with little expectation but they did have a game plan and that was to keep the ball tight in the forwards when possession came their way. For near enough all the game they did this to perfection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first half Aspatria enjoyed a strong wind at their backs as they attacked the club house end. They used the conditions wisely to pen Morpeth back and took a near immediate lead when Barwise neatly squeezed in at the corner for 0-5. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The momentum for the try came from a line breaking run from second row Jude Wilkinson who in his first season with Aspatria continues to impress.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Aspatria-rugby-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-335354\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Aspatria-rugby-3.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Aspatria-rugby-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Aspatria-rugby-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Aspatria-rugby-3-219x146.jpg 219w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Picture: Barney Clegg</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The pressure was too much for Morpeth who following the early score conceded a succession of penalties and with only 12 minutes elapsed Stoddart had used two of these to provide Aspatria with a 0:11 advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morpeth, perhaps recognising that they were not going to get any change out of the visiting pack began to play a more expansive game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For them this was the correct tactic and it worked. By the 21st minutes two fluent backs moves delivered a couple of converted tries to give the home side a 14-11 lead. It very much looked like normal service resumed but Aspatria had other ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morpeth simply could not handle a rampant Aspatria pack. On 23 minutes Wilkinson benefitted from some excellent work by No8 Chris Graham to outpace a covering defence and go over. Minutes later, Wilkinson\u2019s second row partner, Riley Thwaites added a 3rd try.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this stage Aspatria were in full control of the game and in the 10 minutes prior to half time added two more tries, both coming after forceful work by the pack but scored by Stoddard who converted each of them to establish a 23 point gap at 14-37.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the final play of the half Morpeth struck back and yet again it was a backs effort that ran wide and around the Aspatria defence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The half finished with a 21-37 score line in favour of Aspatria. Still a handsome margin but Morpeth had two reasons to feel this game was far from over. Firstly, they now had the benefit of the conditions and secondly they knew that spreading the ball wide was a key to further scores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second half was only minutes old when Morpeth ran in a 4th try and at 28-37 the home side were right back in contention but as the half progressed their frustration began to grow as Aspatria\u2019s ball retention tactics looked to be capable of winning the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was at times ugly stuff as Aspatria ground their way upfield with close in, pick and go moves.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Aspatria-rugby-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-335353\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Aspatria-rugby-2.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Aspatria-rugby-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Aspatria-rugby-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Aspatria-rugby-2-219x146.jpg 219w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Picture: Barney Clegg</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As the game crept into the final quarter Aspatria looked more that capable of holding on for a win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The visitors won a series of penalties in the home 22 as they took apart the Morpeth scrum. Morpeth were warned by the referee and one forward was yellow carded. On the third resetting of a five metre scrum No8 Graham came flying off the back to launch himself over the line for an unconverted score.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Into the final 10 minutes Aspatria held a 28-42 lead but understandably an element of fatigue crept into the Aspatria effort. The game turned dramatically in favour of Morpeth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morpeth were now able to clearly see that Aspatria were in difficulty trying to defend a wide pitch. The home backs proved merciless in exploiting this and long range tries began to flow. It takes some doing to score three tries with only a few minutes remaining on the clock, so credit must go to Morpeth for achieving this with the final one and the game winning score coming with the final play off the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 13-try thriller ended in Morpeth\u2019s favour and they continue the season with an outside chance of promotion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the dust settles Aspatria will recognise that the bonus points earned may prove vital if the relegation battle gets any tighter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, and based on this performance they can look forward with optimism for 2025 when a full complement of players will be back in action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This report cannot end without praising all the players who travelled to Morpeth, particularly Dixon and Jonker who came out of retirement and played their parts magnificently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris Graham took the man of the match honour but in truth there would have been little argument if any of the pack had been named. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The performance of Steven Stoddart operating at No10 also demands recognition. With the wind blowing a gale the experience of Stoddart was invaluable.</p>\n",

Kieran Mewse&#8217;s conversion was on target but was buffeted sideways by the wind just as it reached the sticks, leaving the score at 5-0.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The game remained a tight battle, but Keswick were stronger in the scrum, their pack dominated, and quick distribution by Matty Roper, clever kicking from Glen Weightman, and the pace of Chris Potter in particular gave Keswick the upper hand. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"560\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Kirkby-Lonsdale-ready-for-the-line-out-Ben-Challis.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-335335\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Kirkby-Lonsdale-ready-for-the-line-out-Ben-Challis.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Kirkby-Lonsdale-ready-for-the-line-out-Ben-Challis-300x164.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Kirkby-Lonsdale-ready-for-the-line-out-Ben-Challis-768x420.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Kirkby-Lonsdale-ready-for-the-line-out-Ben-Challis-260x142.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Kirkby Lonsdale ready for the line out (Ben Challis)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Keswick then again put sustained pressure on the Kirkby Lonsdale try line, using repeated scrums to drive forwards, with Man Of The Match Dan Alllaker putting in a tremendous shift. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Lewis Bell and Karl Smyth came close to scoring before it was James Benson who crashed through under the sticks to secure Keswick&#8217;s second try which Mewse duly converted for a 12-0 lead at half time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second half opened with a prolonged hail storm, with the remaining supporters struggling to make out what was happening further away on the pitch in the fading light for much of the next 40 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With footings now treacherous, it was Allday who again used his speed to set up what was going to Keswick&#8217;s third try. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was tackled a metre short of the try line, and when the tackler then failed to release Allday, with any of Potter, Mewse and Roper well placed to pounce and score,\u00a0referee Martin Maughan no option but to award Keswick a penalty try and seven more points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final try was another Allday sprint, chased by three closing\u00a0 Kirby Lonsdale defenders, with Allday opting to dive five metres out, somehow sliding forwards on the soaking wet and now icy pitch to come to a stop well over the visitors&#8217; try line, despite all three defenders holding onto him, to cement a very good win.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"663\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/James-Benson-crashes-in-to-touch-down-Ben-Challis.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-335333\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/James-Benson-crashes-in-to-touch-down-Ben-Challis.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/James-Benson-crashes-in-to-touch-down-Ben-Challis-300x194.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/James-Benson-crashes-in-to-touch-down-Ben-Challis-768x497.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/James-Benson-crashes-in-to-touch-down-Ben-Challis-225x146.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">James Benson crashes in to touch down (Ben Challis)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>With the clubs around Keswick in the league\u00a0all losing (Carlisle 21-55 to Middlesbrough, Upper Eden 14-22 to Consett, Aspatria 42-47 to Morpeth and Guisborough 12-57 to West Hartlepool) Keswick now sit in seventh spot in the league, and have a game in hand over sixth placed Consett.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Head coach Garry Holmes said: &#8220;A lot of praise must go out to the players on both teams for battling hard in horrendous conditions.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Playing into the wind in the first half, our defence held well, and Kirkby didn&#8217;t use the wind as we expected them too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When they did kick, Kieran Mewse was solid at the back and got a lot of joy running it back.

This year, Clark will need to double his efforts to create an ideal festive experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With unsophisticated relatives crashing the celebration, malfunctioning electronics threatening to blow the house apart, and a run-in with the law putting the festivities at risk, the odds are stacked against him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key to success might lie in one thing: the Griswolds must unite. But how challenging can it be to embrace the holiday spirit and host the most unforgettable Christmas vacation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parental guidance rating: 12A</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/carlislecultcinemaclub\"><strong>You can keep up with screenings and the club&#8217;s latest news here.</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thecarlislecultcinemacast.buzzsprout.com\"><strong>To listen to the Carlisle Cult Cinema Cast, click here.</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtube.com/@carlislecultcinemaclub?si=B10gLSYtYWMsDZfm\"><strong>To watch the Carlisle Cult Cinema Cast on YouTube, click here.</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also listen to Paul&#8217;s radio show on CRFM 102.7, where he plays tunes from movies, TV shows and adverts every Monday from 10pm until midnight.</p>\n",

They are preparing for a busy Christmas Eve but will be up bright and early to go to Keswick parkrun which is a bit closer to home for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shaun Silson, a popular parkrunner and former teacher at Ullswater Community College, achieved his 250th parkrun today and was cheered on by his family and many friends. Well done, Shaun!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another regular, Tim Daldry, reached his 50th parkrun and was supported by his wife, Amanda and others who are part of a Messenger group of about 12 members, who like to follow their parkrun with a coffee at The Arturo Lounge in the New Squares. The group is open to all.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Shaun-Silson-celebrates-250-Parkruns-with-wife-Gill-and-son-James.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-335252\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Shaun-Silson-celebrates-250-Parkruns-with-wife-Gill-and-son-James.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Shaun-Silson-celebrates-250-Parkruns-with-wife-Gill-and-son-James-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Shaun-Silson-celebrates-250-Parkruns-with-wife-Gill-and-son-James-768x576.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Shaun-Silson-celebrates-250-Parkruns-with-wife-Gill-and-son-James-195x146.jpg 195w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Shaun Silson celebrates 250 parkruns with wife, Gill and son, James</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Parkrun wouldn&#8217;t happen without our volunteers and the man in charge, David Robertson works hard to make sure there are always plenty of marshals, scanners, timekeepers etc to ensure a smooth, safe and enjoyable experience for everyone. Thank you, David for all your hard work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also extremely lucky to have a regular team of pacers who help runners achieve PBs and goals. Today they all sported Santa hats to accessorise their blue bibs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to these guys too and to all our volunteers, many of whom will be back on Christmas Day as Penrith parkrun puts on its first ever Christmas Day run. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are around, why not kick off your jollifications with a festive run amongst the friendly faces at Frenchfield?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A full list of participants, results and volunteers can be found at<a href=\" https://www.parkrun.org.uk/penrith/results/latestresults/\"> https://www.parkrun.org.uk/penrith/results/latestresults/</a></p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"report-alison-rowsell\">Report: Alison Rowsell</h3>",

With National Minimum Wage and employer National Insurance Contributions increasing in April 2025, employers will need to be extra vigilant in these areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If HMRC launches an investigation the range of records and documents the inspector might check is vast and will likely include your annual HMRC tax returns, any PAYE records, tax you have paid, self-assessment returns, full company records or tax calculation evidence.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"if-you-would-like-tax-advice-and-support-for-you-and-or-your-business-please-call-01768222030-or-email-helparmstrongwatson-co-uk\">If you would like tax advice and support for you and/or your business please call 01768222030 or email <a href=\"mailto:help@armstrongwatson.co.uk\">help@armstrongwatson.co.uk</a></h3>",

We are sure this team will be one to watch and once again it\u2019s great we have introduced British speedway into some more exciting new talent from the continent in Fraser Bowes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI think the key to next season will be our reserves. Last season we struggled in that department for most of the year which probably hindered us in the playoffs when you look at other teams, but securing Vinnie Foord and Jacob Hook will be huge for us. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Vinnie showed everyone last year he is pure box office and is prepared to put himself on the line to win, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. The sport needs these characters and a team needs these characters to be successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAt the end of last season, I said we only wanted to sign a rider that wanted to ride for Workington \u2013 and every single rider we have signed has already shown their commitment and enthusiasm to the club which is fantastic.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said last season was a great achievement for the team, as Comets reached the play-offs, but 2025 would need to see the side go one &#8211; or two &#8211; steps further. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: &#8220;I think the team we have secured for next season is a formidable one. Of course, we haven\u2019t turned a wheel for next season yet, but everything is looking really positive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have signed the team we want, the uptake for season tickets has been outstanding and we are also retaining and gaining new sponsorship partners for next season already.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI think our fans should be very excited for next season, it\u2019s a team with bit of edge to it again. We just need our fans and Workington as an area to come out in force in 2025 to support our club, as I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to be another fantastic season.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were some hard decisions to be made in building this season&#8217;s team, he added, and losing captain Craig Cook was one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added:  \u201cWe had to make some tough decisions in our team-building process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe knew that we wanted two stronger reserves than we had last year for next season and unfortunately it came down to numbers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Craig did great for us last season, he seemed to be enjoying his speedway again which was brilliant to see and he was also a fantastic captain but it was a decision that had to be made and we didn\u2019t take it lightly. We all wish him well with Berwick next season.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Team boss James Denham added: \u201cWe are all really pleased with what the team we have built for 2025, and once again we really do think this will be a competitive team next season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTroy Batchelor had a fantastic year for us last season, he rejuvenated his passion for the sport and enjoyed his speedway again with us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He was also great with the riders and fans alike last year and really stepped up to the occasion in the big meetings such as Berwick and Redcar when we were chasing the playoffs and were down on numbers.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWith in that in mind, it was an obvious decision to make him the captain for next season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think he has some solid backup as well, Tate Zischke and Antti Vuolas will know what to expect of all the away tracks now and Jye Etheridge is already vastly experienced in the UK. Also Vinnie, along with Jacob, will probably be one of the strongest reserve duos in the league.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFraser Bowes will also come over to us with a vast amount of experience on the continent to make his British speedway debut, but like Tate and Antti last year there will need to be a few meetings where he gets up to speed in the UK.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Squally showers, hail and thunder are also possible in some places. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The weather forecaster said there is a potential for delays to public transport and some disruption to the road network, which may have a greater than usual impact given the busier pre-Christmas weekend travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It added that dangerous coastal conditions can be expected too, with large waves an additional hazard.</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-should-i-expect\">What should I expect?</h2>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are likely</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It\u2019s likely that some coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities will be affected by spray and/or large waves</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Probably some bus and train services affected, with some journeys taking longer</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some short term loss of power and other services is possible</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely</li>\n\n\n\n<li>There is a small chance of isolated, short term loss of power</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-should-i-care-about-weather-warnings\">Why should I care about weather warnings?</h2>\n\n\n<p>Weather warnings are issued to let people know what weather is in store for their area and what its impact could be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Met Office is the UK\u2019s official weather service and is responsible for issuing weather warnings to the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three main levels of weather warning:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Yellow \u2013 which asks people to be prepared for disruption</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amber \u2013 which asks people to change plans that could be impacted by the weather and take action to protect themselves and their property</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Red \u2013 which is issued for weather that poses a danger to life and asks people to immediately take direct action to keep themselves and others safe from impacts of the weather</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Yellow and amber warnings represent a range of impact levels and likelihoods. This means it is important to read each warning to know what level of impact to expect in your local area \u2013 and how likely those impacts are to occur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Met Office began issuing impact-based warnings in 2011 \u2013 which means that warnings are issued when the weather may have an impact on people\u2019s day to day lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous to this, warnings were issued to the public when certain weather thresholds or levels were reached.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Impact-based warnings take multiple factors into account \u2013 these include time of day, if it may impact traffic, time of year, if the weather is unusual, if there are any seasonal events taking place and if the area is well equipped to deal with the weather.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each warning level is designed to help people take steps to minimise the chances of disruption in their liv</p>\n",

\u00a378 million Citadels campus are moving forward, the institution&#8217;s bosses said and Vice Chancellor Professor Julie Mennell welcomed city MP Julie Minns for a tour of the site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The university said the lion\u2019s share of the overall funding required &#8211; \u00a350 million &#8211; is being provided by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government through the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal with an additional \u00a35.2m from the Carlisle Town Deal Fund.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The university is also contributing to the cost of the scheme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A formal request to the Borderlands Partnership Board is seeking an additional \u00a38 million of funding and is awaiting approval from Government.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process to appoint a contractor continues, with a decision expected by spring. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"

welcome students from 2027.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Carlisle Citadels campus project is one of the city\u2019s major regeneration schemes and is supported by the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Professor Mennell led Mrs Minns on a tour starting outside the hospital wing, followed by the vacant retail units on English Street, which gave a view of where the Gateway Building will be located, the Woolworths/ Burtons building (Hub Building) and the former Armed Forces Careers Centre, location of the Carlisle Business Exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once inside the buildings a series of CGI images were displayed with QR codes that brought the space to life through the use of augmented reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also on the tour were representatives from Cumberland Council, Borderlands Partnership, Day Architects and Identity Consult who are supporting the university with the planning and consultancy around the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prof Mennell said: \u201cWe are happy to have this opportunity to update the city\u2019s MP on progress made to date and the next steps of this major scheme. </p>\n\n\n<div id=\"jig1\" class=\"justified-image-grid

This means it is illegal to use them on the road or in public spaces, such as parks, street pavements, and shopping centres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last 12 months officers in Cumbria have seized 39 e-scooters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is only legal to use e-scooters on private land such as your garden, but you must have permission from the landowners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are trial areas in which you can rent an e-scooters &#8211; however there are none in Cumbria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspector Jack Stabler, from Cumbria police&#8217;s Road Policing Unit, said: \u201cIn Cumbria, it remains against the law to ride a privately owned e-scooter on public roads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhile we understand why people may want to buy them for Christmas its important you are aware of the laws and that you comply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf anyone is found to be riding an e-scooter on a public road or footpath the e-scooter could be seized, your present lost and you will be reported for offences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThese aren\u2019t toys and can cause serious injury to riders or other path or road users if ridden irresponsibly.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service said there were dangers associated with rechargeable batteries built into e-scooters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cheaper and non-branded e-scooters can pose a risk of fire. Even expensive versions can cause a fire if they are not charged appropriately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service\u2019s Lauren Woodward, area manager for prevention and protection, said:\u00a0\u201cWe would discourage anyone from buying an e-scooter due to the legalities of using it on public roads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHowever, if you do have one, they should be charged in a safe manner. Simple tips such as: Not charging it while you sleep; unplugging the charger once it\u2019s done; not covering the charger or scooter whilst it charging to let any excess heat escape; ensuring the e-scooter aren\u2019t blocking an escape route in the event of a fire and not overloading plug sockets will reduce the risk of fire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf you have a stolen or counterfeit e-scooter, we would strongly advise you not to use it as it may not have been through the appropriate safety tests that legitimate sellers need to pass in order to sell their wares.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe want everyone to have a safe Christmas without a fire so please be careful around rechargeable electronics.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cumbria\u2019s Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner David Allen, said:\u00a0\u201cE-scooters are still growing in popularity, but it is really important that we take the law into account when buying them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI would urge all parents and family members not to buy an e-scooter for their children \u2013 we don\u2019t want to see anyone have their present seized by police, or worse, hurt in an accident on our roads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI would also encourage anyone who already owns an e-scooter to follow the safety tips provided by Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service \u2013 no one wants a fire in their home due to leaving a charger on for an inappropriate amount of time or due to faulty goods.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPlease be sensible, think through your gifts and stay safe.\u201d</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"e-bikes\">E-bikes</h2>\n\n\n<p>You can ride an electric bike if you are aged 14 or over, as long as it meets certain requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These requirements are that the&nbsp;E-Bike must be classed as an&nbsp;electrically assisted pedal cycle (EAPC).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An EAPC must:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Have pedals that can be used to propel it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Show either the power output or the manufacturer of the motor.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Show either the battery\u2019s voltage or the maximum speed of the bike.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have an electric motor with a maximum power output of 250 watts.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Not have a motor able to propel the bike when it\u2019s travelling at more than 15.5mph.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If an electric bike falls within the EAPC definition, legally it is treated like a regular, non-assisted pedal cycle. You don\u2019t need to register the bike and you don\u2019t need to have insurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the e-bike does not meet the definition it is not legal for use on the road or public spaces.&nbsp; This would include pavements and pedestrianised areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is specifically relevant where motor input is controlled by a twist grip on the handlebar and there are either no pedals or the main propulsion is not by using the pedals.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These machines are treated by UK law like petrol-powered mopeds. This means they must be taxed and insured, you must have an appropriate licence and you need to wear a motorcycle-style helmet to ride them.</p>\n",

Upon checking the garden shed, the bike was missing and entry had been forced.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two padlocks had been snapped and an apparently dropped Nokia mobile phone was recovered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cA neighbour to the burgled address provided footage to police and named the defendant as walking with two other males at 3.45am,\u201d said Ms Johnstone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further CCTV enquiries were made and the motorbike was spotted at 3.22am. \u201cMr Warnock was identified as a potential defendant having been named (the neighbour) as being involved,\u201d added the prosecutor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Warnock was arrested four days later and quizzed three times by police before being bailed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On November 5, at around 2.30am, a male was twice seen trying the door handle of the witness\u2019s address. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Warnock then visited a neighbouring property and, when the witness\u2019s name was mentioned, he stated: \u201cYou two threw us under the bus. I\u2019d think twice about going to court.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an impact statement, the key witness outlined the emotional impact. \u201cI was petrified of coming to court for the original case. He was trying to intimidate me. It didn\u2019t work,\u201d said the witness, who admitted: \u201cI came close to dropping it. It has left me thinking \u2018who\u2019s lurking around, who\u2019s watching?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The witness\u2019s children were woken and had also been affected. \u201cI should be able to give a witness statement if I choose,\u201d they added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defence lawyer Matthew Hopkins, mitigating, spoke of Warnock suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder &#8211; ADHD &#8211; and a prolonged and entrenched history of substance misuse which started when he was 14 but which he was committed to addressing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Warnock, of Drumburgh, west of Carlisle, was given a 10-month jail term by Recorder Eric Lamb after admitting burglary and witness intimidation.</p>\n",

He asked whether she liked alcohol, and suggested a party drink of vodka and cocaine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the chat switched to WhatsApp, Goulding requested indecent pictures and also made a series of sexually explicit suggestions as the decoy amassed a wealth of evidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That information was handed over to Cumbria police along with voice notes containing more suggestive comments by Goulding, who was arrested and interviewed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHe did answer questions in which he suggested he had been set up by a vengeful ex-partner,\u201d prosecutor Stephen McNally told Carlisle Crown Court. \u201cHe denied knowing about the girl\u2019s account and denied conversing with her. He denied having any sexual interest in children.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When brought to court, Goulding admitted offences of attempted sexual communication with a child and attempting to cause of incite a child to engage in sexual activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was sentenced today when a judge heard he had 34 previous convictions for 113 offences, the majority for dishonesty. There were no past sex crimes on his record.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrew Gurney, mitigating, spoke of Goulding\u2019s disadvantaged upbringing and ongoing mental health issues in adult life. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He is disgusted by his own behaviour. He is genuinely, truly remorseful for what he has done,\u201d said Mr Gurney. \u201cThis will obviously have a significant impact on his life moving forward.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Goulding was given a 45-month prison sentence by Recorder Eric Lamb.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He must sign the sex offenders\u2019 register \u2014 and comply with the terms of a prevention order \u2014 indefinitely.</p>\n",

However, as we discussed with the Health Adult Scrutiny Committee, no decisions have been made and there are no final plans to pause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s only right that we talk to our teams first and consult with them on proposed plans to change the way they work as per trust policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis is their opportunity to feed into the proposed plans moving forward; and based on the feedback we have received to date, it is likely there will be some changes to the proposals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOnce we have finalised the revised proposals, we will discuss them with our teams again to ensure we have heard correctly and made the changes required to resolve any major concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe will also share with our commissioners to advise on whether they believe the plans are substantial service variation and therefore, require public consultation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We will then discuss with the Furness Locality Board and HASC as agreed with the committee this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf the final plans hit the threshold for public consultation or a wider engagement piece of work; we will, of course, support that fully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn the meantime, most of the concerns raised by the public surrounding end of life care provision, privacy and dignity of gynaecology patients, etc, are the same themes that have come up in the colleague consultation and we aim to address those in the revised plans in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf we are unable to address them, the changes will not go ahead.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Labour MP also asked the trust to confirm that the gynaecology ward would no longer be single-sex but that there will be single-sex bays within a mixed ward, and queried if a risk assessment had been carried out on this approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A trust spokesman said: \u201cIf the proposals are accepted as they are now, then gynaecology inpatients would be in a dedicated area within Ward 5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Ward 5 is made up of single sex bays where patients do not share a bay or facilities with members of the opposite sex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cA Quality Impact Assessment and Equality Impact Assessment has been completed for these changes which I believe we have shared with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;These are clear that any changes must not compromise the privacy and dignity of women.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to be clear \u2013 if we cannot protect the privacy and dignity of our patients, the changes will not go ahead.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron Cummins, trust chief executive, previously said at the health and adults scrutiny committee meeting that the drive behind the proposed changes to Furness General Hospital is to make sure patients get the right care, in the right place, at the right time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a report prepared by the trust, the proposed changes strongly supported NHS plans for patients to receive care at home or closer to home where appropriate with support from nurses, therapists, social carers, volunteers and doctors in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report said this time last year the trust had around 150 patients not meeting medical criteria to reside in hospitals, but this number has been reduced to around 100 in October 2024 due to work with primary care and local authorities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It added that Parkview Gardens in Barrow which currently provides 16 intermediate care beds will soon be providing 24 beds in an environment to support patients in their rehabilitation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report states no members of staff will lose their job or be required to work at another of the trust\u2019s sites as part of the proposals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chief executive also told council chamber the proposed changes will provide the hospital with capacity for when the population grows with the BAE Systems expansion in Barrow and said Furness General Hospital had a bright future.</p>\n",

Their commitment to our cause allows us to continue providing a safe place for animals in need.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lauren Pickthall, animal rehoming manager at Animal Concern, said: \u201cWe are delighted by the wonderful support from the WCF Cockermouth team and very excited to offer the dogs in our care a special Christmas Day lunch. Roxy has already sniffed the lunches out in the storeroom, so they must smell extra tasty!\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Ulverston, the WCF team has been working with Animal Welfare Furness as pet poverty is a known issue in the area. The festive feasts will be delivered directly to the families most in need, offering a pet food bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma Fawcus, charity manager at Animal Welfare, said: \u201cIt has been fantastic to be partnered with WCF Ulverston this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The team and customers have been a great support to the work we do, and their festive campaign, \u2018No dog should go hungry this Christmas\u2019, fits in wonderfully with our own aspirations of donating pet food to those in need this Christmas. The Christmas dinner boxes will allow us to reach more people in our community with dogs that may have empty bowls without our help.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year\u2019s Christmas Day lunches will feature the Lakes Heritage Festive Feast, an own-brand dog food made for WCF Pet &amp; Equestrian in the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not too late to get involved. Pre-filled donation bags, packed with food, toys, and healthcare items, are available in-store now, with all items delivered directly to local charities.</p>\n",

Discovery Sports remains committed to delivering an action-packed, engaging 2025 FIM Speedway GP series that can be enjoyed by millions of fans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In 2024, we had record numbers of fans watching the FIM Speedway GP series on our platforms and a host of sold-out events, as well as staging racing in front of nearly 50,000 fans at PGE Narodowy in Warsaw (Poland), the world\u2019s biggest speedway attendance in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In 2025, we are incredibly excited to bring the FIM Speedway GP series to the iconic National Speedway Stadium in Manchester, a true heartland of the sport, meaning British fans can still watch their favourite riders live and in-person next season as part of an exciting double-header.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The difficult but necessary decision to replace Cardiff on the 2025 calendar, made in close consultation with the FIM, has not been taken lightly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;However, a combination of logistical challenges, rising\u00a0costs\u00a0impacting the event and its contributing stakeholders,\u00a0and declining attendances have prevented us from positioning Cardiff as an event that met commercial, or spectator attendance targets post-Covid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It is a decision we have made for commercial reasons and a move that ensures the long-term sustainability of the series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We will continue to deliver on our plans to capitalise on the popularity of speedway elsewhere and we support the sustained expansion of the sport at all levels of the SGP pyramid \u2013 ensuring we provide an even more compelling product for fans while helping the sport to grow even further.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2025 FIM Speedway Grand Prix season will start with the\u00a0FIM Speedway GP of Germany \u00a0on Saturday, May 3, when Polish world champion Bartosz Zmarzlik bids to win a record-equalling sixth FIM Speedway World Championship.</p>\n",

They have all been reviewed and judged by the Love Barrow Awards committee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chair of the Love Barrow Awards committee, DT Guest, said: &#8220;This year has seen a record number of nominations from the public, who have nominated local individuals or groups who go that extra mile to support others. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The awards night is a fantastic event, and would not be possible without the support of our sponsors and patrons, and I would like to thank them for once again giving very generously.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each finalist has sat down in front of the camera at the Holiday Inn Express, Barrow and at Furness College to talk about their experience as a community champion, sharing the inspiring stories behind their nomination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The videos will be played on the awards night and shared at the same time on Facebook before the winner of each category is announced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now the Love Barrow Awards committee needs the community\u2019s help. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They will shortly be asking for people&#8217;s support in selecting the winner of the People&#8217;s Choice Award 2025, sponsored by BAE Systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DT Guest said: &#8220;This award is chosen by the public from one of the amazing finalists, and we will be asking them to vote for their community hero.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each year the thousands of votes make the award very, very close! We often don\u2019t know who will win until just before voting stops.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voting for this will open in mid-January 2025, and the winner will be announced at the awards ceremony.</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"love-barrow-finalists-2025\">Love Barrow finalists 2025</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"community-focused-business-of-the-year\">Community focused business of the year</h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Chatsworth Signs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MKM Barrow</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Charnley&#8217;s Home and Garden</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"teacher-of-the-year\">Teacher of the year</h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>David Reddy</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Marion Stanton</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sue Hannan</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"carer-of-the-year\">Carer of the year</h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Valerie Kirkby</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dawn Huitson</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sharon Durdu</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"group-project-of-the-year\">Group project of the year</h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Andy&#8217;s Man Club</li>\n\n\n\n<li>128 (Barrow-in-Furness) Squadron RAFAC</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Furness Group Riding for the Disabled</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"citizen-of-the-year\">Citizen of the year</h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Ben Tiffney</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maurice Watkin</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jonathan Weakley</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"young-citizen-of-the-year\">Young citizen of the year</h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Jack Hampshire</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lincoln Johnson</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Scarlett Hardman</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-oak-tree-award\">The Oak Tree Award</h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Barrow RNLI</li>\n\n\n\n<li>St Mary&#8217;s Compassionate Communities team</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Inspira </li>\n</ul>\n",

Visitors can explore objects from the diverse communities that have called Carlisle home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The gallery will also feature\u00a0Faunus, a new work by Nicole Bishop, drawing inspiration from Cumbria Biodiversity Data Centre\u2019s earliest record from 1512.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Art will also extend out of the gallery into the new welcome area.\u00a0Hold Fast, Stand Sure, I scream a revolution,\u00a0a large-scale installation of ceramic mushrooms by Serena Korda will hang from the ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The work was acquired with support from Arts Council England/V&amp;A Purchase Grant Fund, Art Fund, and the Henry Moore Foundation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will open its doors to the public on Saturday, February 15. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Tullie-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-334978\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Tullie-3.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Tullie-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Tullie-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Tullie-3-219x146.jpg 219w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The revitalisation of the caf\u00e9 and purpose-built shop are designed to complement the museum\u2019s ethos of inclusivity, creativity and sustainability, featuring locally sourced, bespoke products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shop will be curated much like the museum and galleries, representing local makers, producers and businesses, with unique ranges that are exclusive to Tullie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is hoped the transformed caf\u00e9 will provide a destination dining experience in its own right.

Solar panels will also be installed on the roof, energy-efficient LED lighting installed and an air source heat pump to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The market hall is closed and the work is due to be finished in March. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Westmorland and Furness Councillor Virginia Taylor said: &#8220;We\u2019ve had some positive conversations with Government on this funding, including just how much the delays are impacting our beloved town centre, and while they are committed to honour as many of the Levelling Up Fund Round 3 projects that they are able to, we still have a way to go until we receive any terms and conditions or actual funding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So for now we\u2019ll push on with the enabling work at the indoor market and continue to reassess the project should terms and funding be received.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Government acknowledged the funding was being made available in the Autumn Budget earlier this month and discussions are under way to confirm the agreement in order to secure the funding, subject to further Government monitoring, the council said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coun Taylor said the decision to close the market temporarily for the initial work was not taken lightly, but because the work would reinvigorate it.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: &#8220;Kendal has had a market charter since 1189 and Westmorland and Furness Council takes the responsibility of being the market\u2019s custodians very seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We thank the traders for their hard work over the years, but also for the understanding and co-operation throughout this challenging process. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have taken steps to support traders in the short term and look forward to seeing familiar faces back again when the market hall reopens.&#8221;\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John Davison, who sells pet supplies, said: \u201cI\u2019ve taken the leap and leased new premises on the New Shambles, which is a fantastic location to secure the future of my small business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I took the business on from my beloved daughter Jarre a few years ago, and have loved every minute in the indoor market. We are like a family of traders, and we know the community we have built will continue to support us, with a few of us traders ending up next door to each other in the colourful New Shambles! I look forward to seeing what the council will do next with the markets, especially at a time when investment in desperately needed.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Market users and traders have been talking to the council on what they would like to see from the indoor market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discussions took place with traders to explore their options while the Market Hall is closed, and support packages made available to traders to support them through the project and temporary closure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expressions of interest are invited for traders and other businesses who may be interested in operating in the market when it reopens. More information can be found on the council website at <a href=\"https://www.southlakeland.gov.uk/business-and-trade/markets/\">southlakeland.gov.uk/business-and-trade/markets/\u00a0</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the council gets the go-ahead for the wider scheme, the market hall will be closed for longer. </p>\n",

Those landscapes are in my blood, and they\u2019re central to my work.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After completing her studies at the University of Sheffield, Georgina spent six years teaching modern languages in secondary schools in Barnsley and Staveley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, she said, the birth of her first child in February marked a turning point. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: \u201cI wanted a career that offered flexibility so I could spend more time with my daughter, and I realised this was the perfect moment to pursue my art professionally.\u201d</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Georgina-Hartley-Willows-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-334944\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Georgina-Hartley-Willows-1.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Georgina-Hartley-Willows-1-300x198.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Georgina-Hartley-Willows-1-768x507.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Georgina-Hartley-Willows-1-221x146.jpg 221w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Georgina Hartley-Willows </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Not A Blank Canvas launched earlier this year, specialising in bold, colourful landscapes, original artwork, prints, and bespoke wallpaper murals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her first three wallpaper mural commissions are in Carlisle homes.

He passed away during the pandemic, but his guidance continues to inspire my work.\u201d</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"717\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Georgina-Hartley-Willows-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-334942\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Georgina-Hartley-Willows-2.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Georgina-Hartley-Willows-2-300x210.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Georgina-Hartley-Willows-2-768x538.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Georgina-Hartley-Willows-2-209x146.jpg 209w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Though Georgina now lives in Sheffield with her family, her connection to Cumbria remains strong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of her pieces pay homage to the landscapes she grew up with, and her work seeks to capture the essence of these special places, she said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: \u201cCumbria will always be home.

But when I turned him over I knew it was something far more serious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAll I kept remembering from my first aid training was the first four minutes are critical. Everything I learned came back to me in the moment, and without that training, I don\u2019t think I could have helped him.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the defibrillator arrived, Carl followed the instructions to administer a shock, attempting to restart Nigel&#8217;s heart before continuing CPR until the paramedics arrived and took over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Lyndsey, Nigel&#8217;s wife, the situation was terrifying. She said: \u201cI was at home when one of the lads\u2019 wives messaged me to call her urgently. She said Nigel had collapsed, and he hadn\u2019t moved for 15 minutes. I panicked, trying to get to the hospital, not even knowing if he would survive. It was the longest night of my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking it one day at a time, he\u2019s not 100% yet, but he\u2019s making progress.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nigel is a senior site supervisor from PPP\u2019s Box Encapsulation Plant Product Store 2, known as BEPPS2 at Sellafield. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lyndsey added: &#8220;The support from his colleagues at PPP and the rugby lads has been incredible\u2014they\u2019ve checked in constantly, and it\u2019s meant so much to our family.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nigel spent nearly a month in the hospital, and his recovery has been slow but steady.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nigel said: \u201cIt\u2019s brought us closer together. This could have been a completely different story.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the incident, workers on the BEPPS2 project at Sellafield requested more defibrillators through an observation system, resulting in the installation of two additional units on site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lyndsey said she was grateful to Carl and the team who saved her husband. She said: \u201cThey were absolutely brilliant. I can\u2019t thank them enough for what they did for Nigel and for us as a family.\u201d</p>\n",

Picture: Inspired Meadows</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Plans are in the pipeline to create a 15,000-plot eco burial site on the edge of Kendal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exeter-based Inspired Meadows already has permission to create a 4,000-plot urn burial site on 25 acres of land off the A65 between Summerlands and Endmoor &#8211; but its long-term aim is to offer full eco-burials. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initial work is taking place to create a main entrance, 200 urn burial plots and planting for around 1,000 trees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The firm gained planning permission for the site in 2019 &#8211; but said Covid had caused major delays to work starting on site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is currently able to facilitate urn burials on site, it is still working on gaining planning permission to offer full eco-burials on site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The firm&#8217;s director of operations &#8211; Ellie &#8211; declined to give her surname, and told Cumbria Crack that the hope was to offer 15,000 eco-burial plots on the site, but also added that the exact figure is to be confirmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellie added: &#8220;It has been quite a lengthy process. We bought the site prior to Covid, so it has been a big delay. It&#8217;s taken quite a few years, which is why the work has only just started, as it was as soon as we&#8217;ve been able to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It has to do with a lot of the testing on the site to make sure people are able to be buried there, that it won&#8217;t affect local water systems and surrounding farms, so it has been an extremely lengthy process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But it is a really exciting time for us now. We&#8217;re really excited to see the progress of the site in the next couple of weeks and months and we&#8217;re excited that our clients that have joined us on the journey are as passionate as we are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A lot of land these days is being used up by houses, so its important that we have something to counteract the damage that the new builds are having on the environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are bringing the environment back to Kendal with our site.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"jeg_video_container jeg_video_content\"><iframe title=\"Inspired Meadows: Discover Our Vision with New 3D Artist Impressions\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/megBaS28RWs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspired Meadows currently has planning permission for 4,000 urn burial plots, 36 car parking spaces, toilets and a groundsman&#8217;s store on the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellie said the firm was aiming for the site to be less formal than a conventional cemetery and more of a landscaped natural space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: &#8220;What we are doing is a little bit different to other natural burial sites. We&#8217;re trying to bridge the gap between traditional and natural burials. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Obviously it&#8217;s very regimented in terms of the physical burial process, in terms of you don&#8217;t get embalmed so it&#8217;s better for environment and we use eco-friendly urns or caskets which again contain no toxic chemicals that will harm environment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But a lot of people find natural burial quite scary because you&#8217;re getting put in a field which is unmarked and you&#8217;re not able to walk around knowing there&#8217;s people beneath you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So what we&#8217;re doing is trying to find a perfect blend between a natural and traditional burial by creating beautiful pathways on site and giving people the chance to have a flat to the ground plaque on natural material. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So eventually you&#8217;ll be able to walk through natural gardens to visit loved ones, walk their pets or even have a picnic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Because we&#8217;re planting so many trees and flowers we&#8217;re hoping to create new ecosystems on the site.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The firm held an official launch for the site on November 28 where local businesses and Kendal mayor Jonathan Cornthwaite were invited to look at plans for the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellie added that around 600 to 800 plots can be created per acre and that the site hopes in the future to offer space for up to 15,000 plots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: &#8220;At the moment, the site is a field, but it will rapidly develop over the next few months. It&#8217;s going to happen very quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re a new company, so we&#8217;re working on establishing good relationships with local funeral directors and providers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Kendal and the Lake District in general is a small area so we really want to create partnerships with people who respect clients as much as we do.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will also offer pet burials on site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspired Meadows is aiming to create more sites across the UK, but declined to comment on plans going ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Managing director Stephen Brown set up the company in 2017 after witnessing the increasing demand for sustainable and personalised end of life options. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

This means it is important to read each warning to know what level of impact to expect in your local area \u2013 and how likely those impacts are to occur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Met Office began issuing impact-based warnings in 2011 \u2013 which means that warnings are issued when the weather may have an impact on people\u2019s day to day lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous to this, warnings were issued to the public when certain weather thresholds or levels were reached.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Impact-based warnings take multiple factors into account \u2013 these include time of day, if it may impact traffic, time of year, if the weather is unusual, if there are any seasonal events taking place and if the area is well equipped to deal with the weather.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each warning level is designed to help people take steps to minimise the chances of disruption in their lives.</p>\n",

Kirsten Donald then found Broad out wide on the right and in space.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broad&#8217;s delivery in to the area had enticed Keeper Jess Clayton off her line and saw three would be defenders challenging the sole figure of Barber. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the numerical disadvantage, Barber forced her claim and met the ball after the bounce to lift it over Clayton and in to the empty goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The visitors nearly claimed a third goal with the second half only six minutes old after free kick from just outside of the area from Laura Walker struck Miller&#8217;s far post before being cleared to safety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strikes on goal followed soon after for Bracken and Barber with one sliding past Clayton\u2019s right post and the other flashing over her crossbar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A brave front post header by Keeley Chatters from a Kirsten Donald corner on the left produced a fine instinctive save from Clayton with 20 minutes remaining.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further breaks in behind the North End\u2019s back line from Cassie Donald, Barber and Bracken, and had it not been for the lightening recovery pace of centre back Courtney Woodhead, the home side would have been in on goal.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miller produced a fine fingertip save from a crisp effort from Scott as the game entered the final 10 minutes and in doing so kept the home sides challenge alive.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parity was eventually and justifiably restored with six minutes of the game remaining and in similar fashion to their first goal in that the initial connection started in the back line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Left back Lauren Campbell had carried the ball towards the centre circle before releasing to find Barber. The attacker played the ball back to Keeley Holliday before spinning to threaten again.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Holliday&#8217;s lifted delivery was inch perfect for Barber to take the advantage before she delivered a sweetly struck dipping left footed strike which left Clayton helpless.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ever alert Bracken nearly claimed all three points on offer with less than 30 seconds of the game remaining.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her instinctive run on to a ball delivered from Wagstaff from the right, had left two defenders lagging. However, Clayton had read the danger and was advancing off her line, the ensuing flicked effort from Bracken was all she could fashion, which unfortunately travelled to safety for the visitors.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The game ended soon after with the spoils shared having both teams scoring a pair of goals each.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Barber picked up both the Player of the Game as well as sponsors Westlakes Demolition&#8217;s Player of the Game after a threatening performance throughout and a brace of impressive goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the game, manager Paul Mackenzie complimented the players&#8217; performance over the past four games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: \u201cWe have been in great form over the past month scoring 15 goals and only conceding three. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We were unhappy with certain things in our performance against Atherton, but the way the players have responded since then has been amazing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They have developed a bit more bite and belief and we are all looking forward to taking this form in to the new year.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Workington-Town-Women-Girls-.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-328129\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Workington-Town-Women-Girls-.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Workington-Town-Women-Girls--300x75.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Workington-Town-Women-Girls--768x192.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Workington-Town-Women-Girls--260x65.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Workington Town Women seniors and juniors.

The blaze also destroyed six businesses and impacted a further 78.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cllr Brook said: \u201cI want to say a few words about the tragic fire that took place on December 8 in Kirkby Lonsdale which led to the death of a much-loved local man and a fire that has seen a significant impact on this community, its residents and its local businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe response of the local community has been phenomenal. In addition what has been truly exceptional is the response of all the agencies working together for one cause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFrom the fire crews and the police to local charities to our very own council officers who have been there working on the ground every single day since the incident happened.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cumbria Community Foundation has launched the Kirkby Lonsdale Fire Disaster Recovery Appeal to address hardship caused by the fire, with Westmorland and Furness Council pledging a \u00a350,000 donation, so that the first wave of awards can be made before Christmas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The council response involved a multitude of officers including those from communities, waste, highways, economic development, housing and communications teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cllr Brook added: \u201cThis tragic incident has shown the power and strength of the local community and Westmorland and Furness Council in action on the ground demonstrating what can be achieved through community power in very difficult circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHowever, there will be a long road of recovery for the Kirkby Lonsdale community and with so many significant impacts from this catastrophe. We and our recovery partners now need urgent central support from Government to help our communities and businesses return to normal as soon as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe were pleased to hear that the Prime Minister has promised Lizzi Collinge MP a meeting with the relevant minister to ensure the right help is received where it is needed the most and I hope that this will include match funding for the disaster recovery fund that has just been launched by the recovery group via Cumbria Community Foundation.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/4gGZq5a\">Kirkby Lonsdale Recovery Partnership has issued an update about the town here. </a></p>\n",

We know it&#8217;s going to be a challenge but our focus is on how we can improve from last week.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 600 tickets have been bought by Carlisle fans heading for the Potteries and Williamson praised the fans\u2019 commitment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: \u201cThey&#8217;re just a credit to the football club. The fans probably couldn&#8217;t have endured a worse calendar 12 months. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Their last couple of seasons has been tough and I fully expect and understand the frustration and the disappointment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;All I can say is it&#8217;s very much echoed in this side as well, we haven&#8217;t been good enough but what I can guarantee is we&#8217;ll work our absolute socks off and those boys are giving everything they possibly can every single day to improve, and you will see a full-blooded performance regardless of the outcome but it&#8217;s fantastic to see the support.&#8221;</p>\n",

We believe every child should have something to open on Christmas morning, so we wanted to take this opportunity as a company to pool our resources and contribute to this meaningful cause.&#8221;</p>\n",

But we hope this will offer extra reassurance to women and girls due to concerns we have been made aware of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve listened to what women and girls have said both to our officers in their everyday engagement and in our survey. One of the concerns raised in the survey was about being a victim of crime in the night-time economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs a result our general policing operation around Christmas this year has had an extra focus on violence against women and girls so we can address these concerns, provide reassurance and catch offenders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhether you\u2019re out in our many pubs, bars or restaurants or you\u2019re simply walking home from work in the dark, WalkSafe is a really handy app to have downloaded to your phone to help you plan a night out or get home in the safest way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt can offer you and your loved ones that extra peace of mind when you\u2019re on your night out or journey home.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lisa Brown, Cumberland Council\u2019s deputy leader and portfolio holder for adults and community safety, said: \u201cViolence against women and girls is one of the top priorities of the Community Safety Partnership, and we\u2019ll do all we can to combat it and help everyone feel safe in Cumberland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis app is an incredible tool in helping people feel less vulnerable, and in offering peace of mind to their friends and family. I hope it is well used, allowing everyone to have a great night out in Carlisle, and get home safely.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paul Dickson, Armstrong Watson CEO and managing partner, said: \u201cArmstrong Watson is proud to be a corporate partner in the launch of the new WalkSafe app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis project is testament to our commitment to fostering a secure and inclusive environment within our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are excited to see this innovative app being rolled out in Carlisle and we believe it has the power to provide reassurance and peace of mind to those who choose to venture out after dark and enjoy the Carlisle nightlife.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are delighted to support Cumbria Constabulary, the University of Cumbria and Cumberland Council with this initiative for the city.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gail Howes, head of student services at University of Cumbria, and Daniel Prescott, of the University of Cumbria Students\u2019 Union, said: \u201cIt is important to remember that Carlisle and Cumbria are very safe places and the WalkSafe app is another tool for anyone to have, particularly those who may be new to the area and are learning to navigate themselves around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEveryone deserves the right to feel safe when walking in the city and this app with its safety features such as a route planner and SOS button is a good way towards achieving that.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WalkSafe has previously been rolled out in 35 towns and cities throughout the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app also highlights features like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Venues that operate the Ask for Angela scheme, where people can ask a member of staff for support by asking for Angela.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On-street support, such as the Safer Streets Welfare Hub in Carlisle city centre.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma Kay, WalkSafe Founder, said: &#8220;We are thrilled to be launching in partnership with Carlisle on the WalkSafe+ app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe know that 63 per cent of women prefer to visit pubs, bars and restaurants that have safety initiatives in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur national safety map allows users to see exactly where these venues are and plan safer experiences when accessing the night time economy.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scheme is being run through the Cumberland Community Safety Partnership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a body made up of six statutory partners: Cumberland Council, Cumbria police, Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service, the probation service, and the two integrated care boards that operate across the area, along with many other non-statutory partners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main purpose of the partnership is to reduce crime, disorder, anti-social behaviour, substance misuse,\u00a0re-offending and other behaviour adversely affecting the local environment.</p>\n",

This will lead to a huge increase in noise and low-level disorder, as occurs when people get together late at night.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to the objections, a representative from Domino\u2019s stated the takeaway would have signs displayed asking customers to leave the premises quietly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The branch also has 24-hour CCTV in operation both internally and externally that covers the full area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The applicant said it operated other late night Domino\u2019s stores and continually monitor the situation with customers and if there were any issues, it was prepared to engage a door supervisor if required. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr Abdul said the group operates fast food outlets throughout the UK and added: \u201cWe\u2019ve never had any police complaints.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sub-committee said: \u201cAlthough the sub-committee had considered the concerns of the two residents that submitted written representations, the sub-committee were of the view that the concerns raised did not justify refusal of the application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe sub-committee attached weight to the fact that no responsible authorities had objected to the application, notably Cumbria Constabulary had submitted no objections.\u201d</p>\n",

Obviously it will help the efficiency of the business and reduce costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBut we are also acutely aware that pubs use a lot of energy in cooling beer and generally running the establishment and, as responsible business owners and with all the issues surrounding energy and global warming, we need to be seen to be doing the right thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis is especially important as we employ a lot of young people and they need to be able to look up to business owners and see that the businesses are being run in the right and proper way.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The panels, which have begun to supply around 25 kilowatts of energy this week, are  facing south on the roof of Ye Olde Fleece Inn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris said: &#8220;It has been a long process, working closely with Westmorland and Furness Council as the Fleece is a listed building. It is great to see the council\u2019s forward-thinking attitude when it comes to listed buildings and sustainability.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that a big review focusing on sustainability was now taking place at the duo\u2019s other hospitality ventures in Kendal &#8211; The Gateway Inn near Plumgarths roundabout, The Duke of Cumberland at Appleby Road and Bootleggers in Market Place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe want to reduce our costs but also because it makes sense to do all we can to be more sustainable to help the climate,\u201d said Chris.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPubs have been around for hundreds of years but times are difficult and we have to make sure they remain a cornerstone of the community.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ye Olde Fleece Inn at Highgate had been closed for 18 months until the site was acquired by Chris and Josh. After a nearly \u00a31 million renovation project, it reopened for business in March 2019.</p>\n",

In addition, over 2,200 acres of other habitat will be restored including montane scrub, wildflower grassland, heather moorland and 992 acres of peatbogs.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stephen Trotter, CEO of Cumbria Wildlife Trust,\u00a0said: \u201cWe\u2019ve reached another important landmark in the story of Skiddaw Forest: our purchase has formally completed. This is wonderful news, as we begin the important work of restoring this iconic site in the northern Lake District Fells.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re starting by carrying out in-depth, baseline surveys across the site, from small mammals such as otters, weasels and stoats, to the so-called \u2018lower plants\u2019 such as bryophytes, lichens and liverworts, which play a vital role in the ecosystem. In addition, we\u2019ll survey water quality and flow rates, and check the depth and erosion of the peatland. So the exciting work is already getting underway, in this long-term project which will come to maturity in the coming decades and well into the next century.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re extremely grateful to Aviva and our other funders, and to the over 7,000 members of the public who donated to the purchase of Skiddaw Forest, enabling us to take this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to restore nature on a truly landscape scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Thank you so much to all of you and we look forward to working with our many local partners, farmers, volunteers and others to make this vision a reality that everyone will enjoy for generations to come.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fundraising continues for the restoration work on the site. The charity\u2019s vision is to create a mosaic of healthy, resilient and revitalised mountain habitats, it said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 620 acres of temperate rainforest will be created with native trees that are adapted to live in an upland landscape. Due to the altitude of planting, the trees will be low-growing and fit sympathetically with the aesthetics of the landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Training of seed-collecting volunteers started in the autumn and will continue next year. The native seeds will be taken to new tree-growing hubs in Plumgarths near Kendal, Cold Springs Community Nature Reserve in Penrith, and a site near Keswick where the saplings will be grown on, before eventually forming part of the new temperate rainforest at Skiddaw.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To contribute to the restoration of Skiddaw Forest, go to\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cumbriawildlifetrust.org.uk/skiddaw-forest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://www.cumbriawildlifetrust.org.uk/skiddaw-forest</a>\u00a0or call Cumbria Wildlife Trust on 01539 816300.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n",

He made an immediate impact with some strong carries and offloads to lift the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the stroke of half time Wigton moved the ball well, releasing young winger Jordan Wood and he went 50 metres beating three defenders for a well taken try. Armstrong added the extras to give his side a 15-10 lead at the break.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This proved to be the turning point as Wigton came out energised for the second half and dominated possession and territory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A tiring home pack could not disrupt the speed of ruck ball as well as they had been doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following a burst up-field from Charlie Bell, captain Ryan Wannop took the inside ball and galloped 25 metres for the score with Armstrong converting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Promising young back rower Bell then made another burst up the blind side and this time finished it off himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next score came from good hands along the backline that released Roco Okesene into space and he scored in the corner on his return from a three-month break. The conversion attempt was charged down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The young Egremont side came back and led by a powerful back row and some lively backs caused the Greens to defend several phases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following a couple of rucks close to the line an Egremont forwards crashed over for a try.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the kick-off Wigton won a turn-over and drove close to the line. Although Okesene was stopped five metres out Joe Marrs was able to step his way through two tacklers to score Wigton\u2019s last try.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the last play of the game Egremont were awarded a penalty try from a deliberate knock on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a good performance from Wigton in an entertaining game where both sides tried to move the ball around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next for the Greens is the toughest test of the season so far, unbeaten Penrith 2s away on January 4.</p>\n",

Not only does it place your own life at risk, you pose a serious risk to other road users.<br><br>\u201cIn Cumbria, this is not acceptable behaviour \u2013 the force will be carrying out more checks of drivers over the festive period and enforcing the law &#8211;\u00a0 If you are caught, you will face the consequences.<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t end 2024 by being arrested, or worse, taking someone\u2019s life, because you couldn\u2019t be responsible and stay sober or drug free.<br><br>\u201cI would urge everyone to enjoy the festivities but to drive safe, drive legally and do not ever drive drunk or under the influence of drugs.\u201d</p>\n",

Dackers made it 3-0 from the spot kick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On 35 minutes Dackers completed his hat-trick when a scuffed shot wrong-footed home keeper Casey Sillitoe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It became 5-0 at half-time when Paul Lewis fired across goal for Harvey Macadam who squeezed it in at the back post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morecambe picked up where they left off and scored again in the 51st minute. A ball in from the right was met by a thunderous half-volley from Paul Lewis, which gave Sillitoe no chance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morecambe brought on further experience at the break, with ex Carlisle forward Hallam Hope and Jordan Slew joining proceedings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was Hope who added the seventh on 59 minutes, as he finished calmly from six yards after he was picked out in the box by a low cut back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this play became very scrappy and there was only one more goal with Hope netting his second from a late penalty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carlisle United: Sillitoe, Rigby (Rafferty 72), Hodgson, Skinner (Bell, 55), Fleming, Porter, Murray, Lowes, O\u2019Donoghue (Smith, 63), Fitzpatrick (Lambert, 55), Hopper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morecambe: Burgoyne, Millen, Tutonda (Slew, 45), Songo\u2019o, Taylor, Harrack, Brown (Macadam, 25), Jones (White, 63), Dackers (Hope, 45), P.

Picture:  Google Streetview.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Barrow&#8217;s Forum could be closed for up to two years from next March. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The news was revealed as Westmorland &amp; Furness Council&#8217;s cabinet agreed to recommend that an extra \u00a36 million be pumped into the \u00a317.5m scheme to revamp the market hall after asbestos was found by additional investigations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Full council will make a final decision at a meeting next month and the cash will come from funding that has already been approved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scheme is an integral part of wider ambitions to help Barrow become a more attractive, thriving and vibrant place for people to live and visit, being delivered through the \u00a3200m Team Barrow programme working with the Government and BAE Systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the next phase of asbestos removal \u2013 due to begin at the end of March \u2013 will require the use of heavy machinery that will cause vibration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The council said it had commissioned an independent expert assessment of the likely impact on the neighbouring Forum, which shares some of its structural components with the market building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It said: &#8220;This assessment has determined that there is a risk that asbestos, currently safely contained in the Forum building, could be disturbed by the works starting in the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This means, to protect the public and staff, the council has taken the difficult but responsible decision to close the whole of the Forum building while this work on the market hall is carried out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Initial estimates suggest this phase of work could take around two years.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Councillor Virginia Taylor, Westmorland and Furness Council\u2019s cabinet member for Sustainable Communities and Localities, said: \u201cWe have now received that report and it is clear that, in the interests of the safety of everyone, public, performers and staff, we will not be able to keep the Forum open while those works are being undertaken in the market hall. \u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe temporary closure of The Forum is hugely regrettable and will clearly impact on shows and events planned for next year and beyond. I am really sorry this has to be done and would like to apologise to everyone who will be inconvenienced by the closure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI know the Forum staff are particularly disappointed by this news but will be pulling out all the stops to ensure we do our very best for our customers, promoters, local groups who enjoy their turn on the Forum\u2019s stage and everyone else who uses the Forum. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank our staff, who work so hard year-round to make the Forum a great venue.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Events before the work starting in March will go ahead as planned, including this year\u2019s Christmas production Santa Express.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The authority said it was working with promoters and event organisers to see if it could relocate or reschedule shows and conference facilities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It added: &#8220;We are also looking at options to relocate the popular caf\u00e9 and toilet facilities.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tickets for events scheduled for post-March 2025 are being taken off sale immediately. Should those events be subsequently rescheduled for an alternative venue, ticket sales will be reopened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no risk to current users of the Forum building, including customers and staff. No traces of asbestos have been found in air quality tests and the building will remain open until the next stage of asbestos removal works at the market hall start at the end of March 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theatre space in the Forum building is currently closed following a roof leak which disturbed some asbestos above the main theatre, but this has been safely isolated with the closure of the theatre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All other asbestos in the Forum building is currently safely contained. Any risk associated with asbestos in the Forum only becomes an issue if it is disturbed by the heavy machinery work in the market hall, which will not start until the end of March 2025.</p>\n",

Market Street remains closed to both vehicles and pedestrians, with a cordon in place to ensure public safety. Demolition work on structurally unsafe buildings is underway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The appeal is focused on individual hardship caused by the fire and will broadly support the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>People who have lost their homes and possessions to the fire and been displaced, and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>People who are suffering hardship due to business closure linked to the fire and the loss of income to their households.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If funds allow, community recovery activities</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Immediate hardship needs are being met through the distribution of grant awards by Cumbria Community Foundation, in partnership with Westmorland and Furness Council and the Kirkby Lonsdale Community Cupboard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grant awards will be made by a committee composed of representatives from the Community Foundation and the Kirkby Lonsdale Community Recovery Partnership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Angela Jones, of Westmorland and Furness Council and chair of the Kirkby Lonsdale Community Recovery Partnership, said: \u201cThis fire has caused significant financial hardship and emotional distress to those directly affected and also to the whole community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The full impact of the fire is still emerging, but recovery is likely to take many months, if not years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The community response has been amazing, but many people and businesses have been significantly affected and will be affected for the long term. That is why is it essential that we raise as much money as possible to help support the community with their recovery plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are also working alongside the local MP, Lizzy Collinge to lobby Government for match funding and if we are successful that means for every pound donated the Government would match the same amount.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Councillor Paul Cassell, chair of Kirkby Lonsdale Town Council and a member of the Kirkby Lonsdale Community Recovery Partnership, said: \u201cThe primary aim of the fundraising is to support all families and individuals affected by the tragic fire that has devastated our beloved town. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have witnessed so many unseen acts of support and help and give our sincere and heartfelt thanks to all those who have been kind enough to donate. Recovery is going to be a long process, please support this appeal if you can.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andy Beeforth, Chief Executive at Cumbria Community Foundation, said: \u201cIt is tragic to see such devastation and loss of life in this beautiful market town. The team at the Community Foundation have significant experience of managing disaster appeals and we will bring all our fundraising and grant making skills to help the people of the town.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe have set an initial target to raise \u00a3100,000. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The people of Kirkby Lonsdale have responded magnificently to help their neighbours and friends. They have provided practical and financial support including temporary accommodation, food, clothing, emotional help, the use of holiday homes and a number of GoFundMe pages have raised funds to help specific people and the wider community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We look forward to working with the Kirkby Lonsdale Community Recovery Partnership to support people in their recovery from this horrific episode.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The foundation is working closely with the Kirkby Lonsdale Community Recovery Partnership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The foundation is also co-ordinating its efforts in relation to the Lunesdale Hall GoFundMe page which has now been closed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The appeal is being promoted and supported by Westmorland and Furness Council, Kirkby Lonsdale Community Recovery Partnership, as well as by local news media, regional and national newspaper groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Donations and funds are being sought from:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Individuals and businesses</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Grant making trusts and local, regional and national charities</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Community fundraising events</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Existing and new government funding programmes</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"support-for-businesses\">Support for businesses</h2>\n\n\n<p>Westmorland and Furness Council is co-ordinating efforts in support of local businesses including seeking government support for grant aid and suspension of business rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charitable appeals are unable to support businesses directly. The appeal can support business owners and employees experiencing financial hardship as a result of the fire.</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"to-donate\">To donate </h2>\n\n\n<p>Visit <a href=\"https://cumbriafoundation.enthuse.com/cf/kirkby-lonsdale-fire-disaster-recovery-appeal\">https://cumbriafoundation.enthuse.com/cf/kirkby-lonsdale-fire-disaster-recovery-appeal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out more about the fund, visit <a href=\"https://www.cumbriafoundation.org/fund/kirkby-lonsdale-fire-disaster-recovery-fund/\">https://www.cumbriafoundation.org/fund/kirkby-lonsdale-fire-disaster-recovery-fund/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phase one of the fund will provide immediate short-term relief of hardship. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on funds available, it hopes to make further grant awards in early 2025.

This initiative aims to enhance the perception of Carlisle, increase social value, and ultimately boost economic performance by attracting more residents and visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe artwork we are proposing is part of a wider project to make the city centre a more vibrant and lively destination and to encourage increasing footfall. As a council one of our values is to work collaboratively and we are always looking for new methods of engaging new audiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The artist will work closely with the project team and the building owner to develop a proposal that compliments the area. The design will be signed of by both the North place Project team, North Area Place Programme Board and The Lowther Arcade building owner.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it gets the go-ahead, it will take 10 to 14 days to complete and work would start at the end of January. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lowther Arcade is a Grade II-listed building which was dated 1904 for the Carlisle Old Brewery Company by Henry Higginson of Carlisle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interior wall which has been selected for the mural is not part of the listed elements of the Lowther Arcade and is currently painted white. </p>\n",

The first floor will provide a multi-purpose community space for uses such as health and wellbeing mindfulness/yoga classes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The application said: \u201cThe proposed surgery will provide a public space for patients and staff, futureproof the needs of the patient population and will also create a much-needed central hub for an ever-increasing rural population.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Haverthwaite GP surgery has nearly 3,000 patients and offers healthcare to people in hard to reach areas of western Windermere and Coniston.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In January the Lake District National Park Authority approved plans from John and Helga Barr to offer the Oak Bank in Haverthwaite as an emergency surgery and the property has been used as such since April 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The applicants are now working with Haverthwaite Surgery &amp; NHS Lancashire and South Cumbria ICB to secure a permanent standalone solution in the grounds of Oak Bank that satisfies Care Quality Commission best practice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A report prepared by the authority&#8217;s planning officers said: \u201cThe proposed development would ensure the continuation of an important community facility.\u201d</p>\n",

The Millom Town Deal Board and Cumberland Council remain committed to delivering the Town Deal projects for the benefit of the Millom and Haverigg communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leader of Cumberland Council Mark Fryer added: \u201cThis will be an important step forward for the Millom Town Deal projects. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It is great to see progress being made. Work continues on other parts of the Town Deal projects and momentum continues to build across this transformational programme.\u201d</p>\n",

Officer body cam footage captured her on a call with Irwin, and reporting his vows to batter and knock her out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Days later she obtained safe accommodation but \u2014 despite Irwin\u2019s bail conditions \u2014 continued to stay at his flat in Whitehaven, which she visited on March 22.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just before midnight, Irwin called 999 and said he believed Miss Render was dead. Paramedics attended and found her unresponsive, surrounded by blood-soaked bedding. She was pronounced dead by a doctor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe severe force which caused the injury led to almost immediate bleeding and Miss Render bled to death inside this defendant\u2019s home,\u201d said Iain Simkin KC, prosecuting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Home Office pathologist concluded that pouring blood loss from a terrible injury would have led to her collapsing within 20 minutes and death inside an hour at the latest. She died from a catastrophic haemorrhage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Irwin, of George Street, Whitehaven, denied murder but was convicted, unanimously, by a jury who heard harrowing evidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Crown Prosecution Service has since apologised to Miss Render\u2019s grieving family, admitting that Irwin could have been charged and put behind bars earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was sentenced today having also admitted sexual assaulting her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cShe was without doubt, an extremely vulnerable woman who was emotionally and psychologically trapped inside an aggressive, violent and controlling relationship,\u201d said Mr Simkin, \u201cand it was against that background that this defendant murdered her.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one text to Irwin, Miss Render had said: \u201cIf you did love me, you wouldn\u2019t hurt me again and again and again.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Impact statements revealed she was a mother to seven children cared for by her family; also a sister, a loving auntie, a niece and a cousin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe heartbreak is unbearable,\u201d stated her mum, Hazel Marginson. \u201cNo parent should ever have to go through this. No parent should ever have to bury a child. This will haunt me for the rest of my life. I am a changed woman forever.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Miss Render\u2019s sisters, Caroline, called the impact on their family devastating, saying of Irwin: \u201cTiffany\u2019s caring nature shone through until his cowardly behaviour took her life from us.\u201d Caroline added: \u201cTiffany had a heart of gold.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another sister, Gemma, said: \u201cThe actions and consequences of the defendant\u2019s actions have wreaked havoc through our entire family. The sudden and tragic loss of our Tiffany is something that as a family will haunt us for ever more.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gemma added: \u201cMr Irwin, by his despicable actions and selfish, jealous behaviour has given our family a life sentence of sadness and trauma. Tiffany was a bright, bubbly, clever and oh so loving person. We will miss her massively for the rest of our lives.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peter Glenser KC, mitigating for Irwin, said: \u201cHe didn\u2019t intend to kill her. He is truly remorseful.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mrs Justice Foster accepted it had not been a pre-planned attack. The judge imposed a mandatory life sentence, ruling that Irwin should serve a minimum of 32 years in prison before being considered for parole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cShe was an extremely vulnerable woman and your treatment of her increased that vulnerability,\u201d Mrs Justice Foster told Irwin. \u201cYour history of attacks while drunk reveals a cycle of alcohol, violence, regret.\u201d </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The judge added: \u201cHer appalling injuries were caused by your actions. Only you know the full detail of what happened in that flat.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Irwin must sign the sex offenders\u2019 register for life.</p>\n",

I look forward to hearing people\u2019s views.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phil Wilson, GSK site director, said: \u201cGSK Ulverston has a proud record of delivering medicines to around two billion patients across the world over its 75-year history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As our operations wind down in the town next year, we\u2019re pleased to be leaving a lasting legacy by providing a \u00a32 million donation to the local community and we look forward to hearing your ideas for how this money can best be spent.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A report summarising submissions will be published and used by the task force to create a shortlist of options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A decision on the use of the funding will be made by June 2025 once work has been done to make sure proposals meet GSK governance requirements including assessing for any conflicts of interest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any proposals will need to be for an organisation that is eligible and reputable and has the appropriate capabilities and licences to conduct the activity.

A testament to his selflessness and unwavering commitment to helping others.<br><br>\u201cRicky was more than a brother, more than a son, more than an uncle, more than a father, and more than a friend to many. He was a constant source of joy and support.<br><br>\u201cHis presence was always marked by a smile and a whistle \u2013 a cheerful melody that announced his arrival. He had a special way of calling out to us \u2013 each nickname a token of his affection.<br><br>\u201cAs an uncle, he was also a best friend, always ready to join in adventures or offer comforting words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHis daughter was the light of his life, and the love he had for her was pure and true. Ricky\u2019s kindness, his caring nature, his selflessness, and his boundless creativity touched the lives of hundreds.<br><br>\u201cHe was hardworking and intelligent, yet it was his loving spirit that left an indelible mark on all who knew him.<br><br>\u201cThough we feel his absence deeply, his spirit lives on in our hearts, and the stories we share, and in the memories we cherish.<br><br>\u201cA quote we believe resonates with Ricky\u2019s life: \u2018The best way to find yourself it to lose yourself in the service of others.\u2019 Ricky found himself in the service to others, and in doing so, he touched the lives of so many.<br><br>\u201cMay we find comfort in knowing that his legacy of love and kindness will continue to inspire us all.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone with any information, who witnessed the collision, or saw the vehicles before the incident, are asked to contact police.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They should contact Inspector Jack Stabler or&nbsp;PC Katie Robinson&nbsp;on 101 quoting log 119 of 26 November 2024.</p>\n",

The space on offer at the site means the animals will have greater access to enjoy their surroundings which is part of the applicant\u2019s focus on animal welfare.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to planning documents, the proposed attraction would consist of animal enclosures as well as an expansion of the existing holiday accommodation with the addition of three shepherds\u2019 huts and two safari lodges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also proposed that one of the existing holiday cottages would also be converted to a caf\u00e9 and a welcome centre would be constructed on the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plans state it is the applicant\u2019s intention to house animals including white rhinos, honey badgers, zebras, red panda, sloth, giraffe and lynx. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There would also be farm animals on site including sheep, goats, donkeys and reindeer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The planning statement says: \u201cThe proposal encapsulates the applicant\u2019s vision to create a unique and intimate wild animal experience in the Yorkshire Dales National Park, which would expand and diversify the existing holiday let business at Brockholes Farm, which the applicant has been successfully operating since 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c\u2018Into the Wilds\u2019 visitor attraction would be established as a pre-bookable, wild animal reserve with restricted access providing a unique and educational experience for guests, conveying the importance of conservation and providing visitors with an understanding of the current threats to a selection of wild species found at the site.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The maximum number of spaces available to stay in the onsite accommodation at any one time will be 38 guests over nine separate accommodation units.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would allow for a maximum number of day visitors of 41 guests; however plans state the booking system would operate by having available spaces to book onto an encounter which could all be filled by holiday accommodation guests, so the actual number of day visitors is expected to be less than this number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The application said: \u201cThe visitor attraction would not operate as a zoo and access would be strictly limited through the pre-booking system and guests staying in the holiday accommodation.\u201d</p>\n",

We know how hard they have worked to put this screening in place, and we think it will be an excellent example of how undiagnosed ADHD is potentially affecting offending in a rural location after our first pilot in the centre of London.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cumbria\u2019s Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner, David Allen, said: \u201cCustody suites across the county see people from all walks of life, some needing additional support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis screening supports the police to get to do their job whilst providing individuals with the assistance they need. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This again, shows that Cumbria is innovative in its approach to dealing with complex issues and that just because it is a small rural force, this doesn\u2019t mean that you cannot be at the cutting edge of innovation and problem solving. Cumbria Constabulary is a high performing force that is always looking for ways to improve the service we provide to the residents and visitors to Cumbria.&#8221;</p>\n",

For example, a pupil achieving three A-levels at grades BBC could access a course which has an entry requirement of grades BBB. In order to benefit from the tariff reduction, Year 12 pupils will need to attend a Cumbrian Award Presentation Day at the university in the summer term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Ruth Harrison-Palmer, director of the Institute of Education, Arts and Society at the University of Cumbria, said: \u201cWe are fiercely proud of our people and our place and therefore we are delighted to endorse the Cumbrian Award.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said the award complemented the university\u2019s mission to raise aspirations, attainment and participation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The university said the award provides pupils with opportunities to develop leadership skills, take resilience-building challenges and experience triumph and achievement beyond the academic, setting them apart from other applicants and so justifying the offer of a reduced entry requirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Harrison-Palmer said: \u201cApplicants who have already completed the Cumbrian Award are prime candidates to become \u2018the lifesavers, innovators, adventurers, creatives and educators of tomorrow\u2019.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Danny Gee, headteacher at West Cumbria Learning Centre, created the Cumbrian Award to develop confidence, independence, life skills and pride in Cumbria, as well as linking to the curriculum. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: \u201cA sense of pride in place and belonging is central to what the Cumbrian Award aims to instil, and so we are delighted that fittingly the University of Cumbria will now be recognising the award.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe tariff reduction will greatly benefit those who achieve the award, giving them access to more aspirational courses with higher entry requirements which were previously out of reach.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dale Hill is director of WELL (Western Excellence in Learning and Leadership), which runs the award.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: \u201cA key ambition of WELL is to champion an inclusive approach to those curriculum experiences that can support every child and young person living in this wonderful place, to feel a strong sense of belonging, to have belief and know they are believed in, and to</p>\n\n\n\n<p>become the person they and we want them to be \u2013 successful, happy, resilient, employable and knowing that positive contributions to community are achieved and recognised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCumbrian Award develops the essential skills and attributes that our pupils need to thrive, and we are proud to include it as a key element of our WELL programme delivery.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cumbrian Award was designed especially for Cumbria. It launched in West Cumbria and is due to be extended across the whole county. It is designed to stand alongside pupils\u2019 school test and exam results as a marker of their achievement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WELL, which runs the award, is a pioneering education project which is working to raise attainment and combat educational disadvantage in West Cumbrian schools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WELL is hosted by Cumberland Council and funded by Sellafield Ltd as part of its Social Impact Multiplied (SiX) programme, and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eirini Etoimou, head of corporate sustainability &amp; supply chain development at Sellafield Ltd, said: \u201cThe ability to gain a tariff reduction through the Cumbrian Award ensures that even more young people have the opportunity to benefit from access to Higher Education, especially those who may have previously thought it couldn\u2019t be an option for them\u201d.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to receive the award, primary school pupils must complete six experiences or challenges over Years 5 and 6, two for each strand of the award \u2013 Adventure, Culture and Enterprise. Secondary pupils must complete 9 experiences over Years 7, 8 and 9.</p>\n",

Picture: Barney Clegg </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Keswick held the upper hand regarding territory and possession in their National 2 North derby at Aspatria and ran out worthy 16-6 winners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a satisfying win for the visitors but less satisfaction for those watching the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fluency of play disappeared into the gathering gloom as Aspatria\u2019s penalty count rose into the 20s, and Keswick conceded less but not by many. So it was stop-start in a contest that will be quickly forgotten.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The points gathered by Keswick move them up to 9th place with 21 points, and Aspatria remain 7<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;on 23.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, results elsewhere will be a concern to both clubs. Guisborough and Kirkby</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lonsdale, who have occupied the two relegation slots in past weeks, recorded good wins on home soil. They remain the bottom pair but will no doubt feel that escape is not beyond them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the second half of the season now commenced no team in the current bottom six can consider themselves safe from the drop. Some nail-biting rugby lies ahead for the five Cumbrian sides that are all in this mix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The game at Bower Park began with both sides getting hands on the ball and in those early minutes, it looked likely that the teams were well matched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keswick broke the deadlock on seven minutes with a penalty from Kieran Mewse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He missed with another attempt on 12 minutes but infringements by Aspatria kept on coming and these handed Keswick near continuous field position in and around the home 22.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keswick, near enough, went through their entire playbook attempting to break the resolve of the home defence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were rolling mauls, several five-metre scrums and line-outs plus the odd series of pick and go tactics. Nothing worked. This pattern of play took the game to within ten minutes of the half-time whistle when Keswick determined enough was enough and asked Mewse to cash in on yet another penalty to establish a 6-0 lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conceding only three points was, in a strange way, a victory for Aspatria. It also allowed them to get into Keswick territory from the re-start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keswick by this time had also entered into the gift giving spirit of handing penalties to their opponents and did so shortly after the re-start to give Aspatria\u2019s Jack Clegg his first pop at the posts to half the deficit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a half-time score-line that the home side had done little to deserve. The second half was a much more even affair. Keswick certainly shaded time in possession but they would not again achieve the dominance held during the first 40 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first 10 minutes of the half Mewse and Clegg swopped penalties and the three-point gap was maintained well into the final quarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the intervening time, both teams had opportunities and of these, the best went to Keswick from a kick and chase, providing an overload in the backs division which was ultimately wasted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On 65 minutes Keswick delivered the crucial score of the game. It was a good try and so totally out of context with the rest of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keswick won possession around half-way and shipped the ball to the left where centre Ryan Weir took possession. His arcing run completely outfoxed the covering defence and he was able to sail under the posts. Mewse added the extras and Keswick had a telling ten point lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aspatria saved their best until late in the game, mounting several attacks that might have swung the result but for some committed, last ditch tackling by Keswick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even in the last minute of the game the home side might have rescued a losing bonus point but declined what seemed an easy penalty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, they decided on one last attack at the Keswick line. The charge to the line was cut down by Keswick to end the game.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Barney-Clegg-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-334183\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Barney-Clegg-1-1.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Barney-Clegg-1-1-300x190.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Barney-Clegg-1-1-768x488.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Barney-Clegg-1-1-230x146.jpg 230w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Jack Clegg gets the Aspatria attack moving.

I think that was the only crack in either defence all day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt&nbsp;certainly was a good game for a neutral rugby purest, with big collisions and a battle at every set piece!.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur outstanding players for the day were Karl Smyth and James Benson, who both dealt with Aspatria pressure so effectively, with some big turn overs and some big breaks which saw Keswick regain possession and rebuild momentum.&#8221;</p>\n",

She said \u2018get off me\u2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The woman was seen looking somewhat shaken by a friend in the immediate aftermath. Door staff were alerted. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cShe was shocked by the incident and shaken up. She had never experienced anything like this before,\u201d said Mr Rogerson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an impact statement she also spoke of being left upset, anxious, wary of men and nervous about bumping Aiye. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHe is quite a public figure, playing for the town\u2019s rugby league team,\u201d added the prosecutor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aiye, of Richmond Terrace, Whitehaven, had been suspended by the club after the incident, and was sacked when he admitted a charge of sexual assault at Workington Magistrates\u2019 Court last month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The offence occurred just weeks after Aiye was given a community order at Preston Crown Court both for assaulting his former partner, and harassment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his sexual assault sentencing hearing at Carlisle today, Marion Weir, mitigating, said Aiye had committed no further offences since May.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt was a relatively short-lived incident when the complainant, the victim, turned around and asked him to stop. He did so. That was the end of the matter,\u201d said Ms Weir.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHe was put out of the premises. From his point of view this was a stupid decision, made in drink, which he bitterly regrets. He clearly appreciates the impact on the victim has been significant.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aiye, of Papua New Guinea, was awaiting the outcome of the court proceedings before learning whether the visa which granted him entry to the UK remained in place. His rugby league future, suggested Ms Weir, was in peril.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judge Michael Fanning imposed a 18-month community order. Aiye must complete 200 hours\u2019 community service and work with the probation service aimed at rehabilitation. Aiye must also sign the sex offenders\u2019 register for five years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt must just be down to a sense of entitlement,\u201d said the judge as he sought to understand Aiye\u2019s crime. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it is because you are a sportsman or whether it is because you were in drink.\u201d</p>\n",

The closure plan must include a \u2018detailed animal stock list\u2019 of animals moving to the new site as well as for those the zoo licence holder is not planning on moving to the new site.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Monday December 16, South Lakes Safari Zoo posted on its Facebook page: &#8220;We have some news which we know will be disappointing for many of you. The zoo will close to the public on December 31.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When we took over in 2017 we did so because of our love and passion for the animals in our care and the wider world, when we look back &#8211; hand rearing Cupcake the parma wallaby, training Tibor the giraffe for his jugular blood sample, Remi the jaguar and his cancer removal, Wolfgang the snow leopard and his eye operation, hand rearing capybara, Eloise the giraffe\u2019s pedicures, transforming the lives of Snoopy and the bears with their new enclosure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;From day one when we opened the doors for free, to today when we will do the same for December, we cannot thank the three million-plus of you who have, over the last seven years, visited us, supported our ventures and ultimately celebrated with us our amazing animal world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In 2023 we purchased a 120 acre site at Tebay. Stone Holiday Cottages situated right along the Lune Gorge, at the base of the Yorkshire Dales National Park Howgill fells on one side and facing the Lake District Valley of Borrowdale on the opposite side of the River Lune. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Alongside the holiday cottages and farm animals the site is home to native wild flora and fauna full of biodiversity from grasslands, trees, ancient woodland, pond, rivers, waterfalls, bluebells, and an array of plant life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Part of the site will welcome visitors in 2025.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/2024/12/17/south-lakes-safari-zoo-operators-bid-to-create-for-wild-animal-reserve/\">Official plans for the Tebay site have been lodged to create the wild animal reserve at its Tebay site with exotic non-native species.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plans state it is the applicant\u2019s intention to house animals including white rhinos, honey badgers, zebras, red panda, sloth, giraffe and lynx. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There would also be farm animals on site including sheep, goats, donkeys and reindeer.</p>\n",

For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Drink spiking &#8211; adding drugs or alcohol to someone else&#8217;s drink.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Needle spiking &#8211; injecting drugs into someone else&#8217;s body with a needle or auto-injector pen.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Vape or cigarette spiking &#8211; giving someone drugs in a cigarette or e-cigarette.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Food spiking &#8211; adding drugs to someone&#8217;s food.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Giving someone more alcohol or drugs than they were expecting and had consented to is also spiking. For example, giving someone double shots instead of single ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is sensible not to accept a drink from a stranger or leave your drink unattended. But sometimes people get spiked by people they know and trust too.</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-tell-if-someone-has-spiked-you\">How to tell if someone has spiked you</h2>\n\n\n<p>It can be difficult to know if someone has spiked you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The symptoms vary depending on what someone has spiked you with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can be similar to having excess alcohol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you start to feel strange or more drunk than you thought you should be, seek help straight away. If you feel seriously unwell, call 999&nbsp;or ask someone to get you emergency medical assistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no right or wrong way to feel. Some victims need emergency medical assistance, others don&#8217;t. Whatever your situation, the police are here for you.</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"reporting-attempted-spiking\">Reporting attempted spiking</h2>\n\n\n<p>You can report attempted spiking to police, where a spiking attempt was disrupted before anyone became a victim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If a drink has an unexpected smell, taste or colour.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you notice a tablet or powder in a drink.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you see someone trying to spike a drink.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If someone tried to inject you with drugs but failed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you notice someone behaving suspiciously around a group they clearly don\u2019t know, you can tell security or a member of staff, or report to police.<br></p>\n",

We tried to think of songs people from any generation would know, such as We Wish You A Merry Christmas, Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer and White Christmas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe also provided lunch and refreshments and lots of home-baked biscuits and cakes for both the children and adults to enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe received some lovely feedback from the event.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bolton Primary School said: \u201cThe trip was sponsored by Westmorland Homecare who provided the transport to allow us to attend the music session and an amazing lunch for the children, as well as a little gift for each child. A huge thank you to Westmorland Homecare for this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt allowed our Key Stage 1 children to get involved with the local community, listen to some very talented musicians, have a sing-a-long and some dancing! It made us all feel very Christmassy.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charlotte added that mixing with young people was of real benefit to clients. She said: \u201cChildren don\u2019t see the barriers and treat them just the same as everyone else which is really nice for the clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt is also a great opportunity for children to integrate with elderly people and understand their challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOne of Westmorland Homecare\u2019s key values is enriching people\u2019s lives and this event reflected that. It is not just about caring for clients\u2019 basic needs but going the extra mile to make sure they are getting enjoyment out of life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe service we provide ties in a lot with what Sunbeams is all about. Like us, they focus on people\u2019s abilities, not disabilities, which really promotes people\u2019s self-confidence.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Westmorland Homecare\u2019s Penrith branch, which opened in May, covers Penrith, Appleby, Shap and surrounding Eden villages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Westmorland Homecare provides care to enable vulnerable and often frail people over the age of 18 to live independently in their own home. Its services include homecare, such as help with housekeeping and meal preparation, and personal care, which includes support with medication, dressing and bathing. It also supports people to access their community, living life to the full.</p>\n",

We face all kinds of incidents on land and in water, but the biggest cause this year is cardiac arrests. We&#8217;ve had 13 of those so far. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This could be down to increasing numbers of people getting outdoors in the Lake District.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teams across Cumbria have also attended 770 call outs so far this year &#8211; a rise of 20 per cent compared to the same period last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dozens of the incidents throughout the year were also back-to-back call outs which increase resource strain on teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In October alone teams were called out 70 times &#8211; a number Richard said was unusual for this time of year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richard added: &#8220;2024 has been intense with regards to the number of call outs. By the end of November, the number of call outs was 20 per cent up on 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Last year was a record year for call outs, as we had 714 999 calls to deal with. But last year we also had an abnormal spike of 60 separate incidents at the start of December due to the severe snow event in the south of the county, so it sort of skewed the figures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But as of today, we&#8217;re on just over 770 call outs for the year. So that increase is a worry.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-impact-of-social-media\">The impact of social media</h2>\n\n\n<p>Richard said that mountain rescue attributes the increase in call outs to the growing popularity of the Lake District.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In particular, he said that social media was a big cause of problems for rescue teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: &#8220;Social media causes a lot of problems. People want to share their experiences with the world and a lot of that is beautiful pictures of the Lakes, which attracts more people to come up here looking for things like fairy pools or infinity pools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But that increase can lead to incidents like the near fatal that happened above Thirlmere. Someone tried to help their partner out and and slipped a long way and that could have been fatal.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On TikTok alone, there are over 39.1 million posts tagging the Lake District and videos taken in the area go viral regularly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One recent viral video showed a group of young men finding themselves benighted in very poor weather conditions in Wasdale, in the area of Scafell Pike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richard said while it was encouraging to see people out in the fells &#8211; that being unprepared can have disastrous consequences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;The TikTok shows the young people in a position, as many people do, where they ended up benighted. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think they felt it was a bit of a joke and at that age people do feel immortal, but Scafell Pike in particular is a killer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are black spots up there like Piers Gill and you can get hypothermia in poor weather even in summer, let alone in the winter months. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So although the lads survived and got home to tell the tale, it could have been another disaster.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richard said that 30 per cent of call outs are considered avoidable &#8211; which usually involved people who have found themselves lost or are unprepared for conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/2024/08/30/if-you-cant-navigate-your-way-off-scafell-pike-it-can-kill-you-everything-you-need-to-know-about-this-lake-district-icon/\">Half the call outs Wasdale Mountain Rescue Team face are on Scafell Pike &#8211; where teams regularly respond to unprepared hikers that are lost, injured or trapped on the mountain.</a></p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"keeping-safe-and-supporting-rescue-teams\">Keeping safe and supporting rescue teams</h2>\n\n\n<p>Richard added that the Lake District&#8217;s teams &#8211; who are entirely made up of volunteers &#8211; are feeling the pressure of the increasing number of call outs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richard said: &#8220;Mountain rescue volunteers put their lives on the line to help people. We had a tragic incident with Chris Lewis and that was a totally unnecessary rescue that took place and took the life of one of our team members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve also had a number of team members face Piers Gill incidents because when people go in, they can&#8217;t come out without help and many of those people are left near death. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A team members partner recently said to me one thing they worry about is when their partner goes on a rescue that takes longer than normal, they find themselves not knowing if it&#8217;s just a long rescue or if they&#8217;re hurt themselves. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So this increase is impacting partners, employers, friends and families as well.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richard said that teams in honeypot areas of the Lake District are facing the highest amount of call outs and keeping up with the demand both with recruiting volunteers and funding resource is a constant challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;Nobody in mountain rescue gets paid, we do it because we love the outdoors and helping people in trouble, but we are hoping people will try and be more responsible and prepared when heading out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Keswick alone are about a third up on last year and are very very busy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I joined Wasdale Mountain Rescue Team 40 years ago and we used to have 25 to 30 rescues in a year. Now we are on 160 to 170 and we were on 140 a couple of years ago, so it&#8217;s gradually increasing all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The consequence for us is demands on peoples time as volunteers, we&#8217;re constantly recruiting more team members and that increases our costs and we have to find ways to meet that demand.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the most prepared and experienced walkers can suddenly get into difficulty or find themselves with an unexpected injury.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Year-in-year-out, mountain rescue teams across the county face surges in call outs when weather shifts with the changing seasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/2024/03/08/the-lake-district-can-be-a-beast-essential-tips-for-surviving-our-fells-and-mountains/\">Some incidents are unavoidable \u2013 but rescuers often see times where just a little extra preparation could have made a whole lot of difference</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rescue teams across the Lake District are asking people heading outdoors to use their #BeAdventureSmart service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every person going outdoors in the Lake District should ask themselves three questions before doing so:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Am I confident I have the&nbsp;knowledge and skills&nbsp;for the day?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do I know what the&nbsp;weather&nbsp;will be like?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do I have the right&nbsp;gear?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.adventuresmart.uk/\">You can find out more about Adventure Smart and ways to stay safe by clicking here.</a></p>\n",

Facing a thin cut to the corner pocket a nerveless Smith cooly deposited the final ball for a 74-64 win and a 4-0 Vets A advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last frame of the match Vets A topped off an efficient evening\u2019s work with a solid 60-19 victory to cap off their best result of the season.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Workington Veterans Club A remain fourth in Division One, moving to 17 points. Rack Shack stay third in Division Two with 11 points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Division Two\u2019s Station Road show-cased their strength at home, producing a commanding 4-1 win over Division 2&#8217;s Maryport Social, with Kevin Kirkham shining on the back of a stunning break of 68.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Station Road&#8217;s Tom Thompson opened proceedings with a dominant 70-24 win against Ben Scott in a display of consistency and sharp potting for a 1-0 lead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Darren Lawson extended Station Road&#8217;s advantage in frame two with a composed 71-42 victory over Andrew Sharp, show-casing his tactical prowess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maryport Social&#8217;s Andrew Scott brought the visitors back into contention with a hard-fought 49-7 win in frame three as he defeated the extremely capable John Teasdale to pull the score back to 2-1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In frame four Kevin Kirkham turned on the style with an exceptional break of 68 to overcome Greg Todd by 75-6 earning the crowd&#8217;s admiration in the process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 3-1 to Station Road Mike Walker sealed the match for the Workington outfit with a measured 56-46 win over Gary Miller, rounding off an impressive team performance to end the match at 4-1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Station Road remain second in Division One, moving to 19 points. Maryport Social stay fourth in Division Two on ten points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Current Division One champions Workington Golf Club produced a dominant performance on the road to defeat Division Two&#8217;s Workington Conservative Club 4-1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Golf Club captain Mark Brasted started strongly for the golfers, securing a controlled 56-42 victory over the hugely experienced Julian Plaza.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two-times county singles champion Alan Moore countered the Golf Club lead with a near-flawless 55-7 win over Ryan Ismay highlighting his tactical awareness in abundance for 1-1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Golf Club&#8217;s Bryan Walker delivered a composed display in frame three, defeating David Holland 65-44 in a tightly contested match-up to put his side 2-1 ahead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frame four saw Simon Fraser power past Brian Kendall 72-39 in an impressive performance to put the Golf club into an unassailable 3-1 lead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last frame of the match Mark Cowen ensured he maximised his team\u2019s advantage with a 76-21 win over Ryan Barker to give the Golf Club a 4-1 victory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Workington Golf Club remain third in Division One, moving to 18 points. Workington Conservative Club stay second in Division Two on 16 points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, in the all-United Club clash, Division One&#8217;s United Club A asserted their superiority with a 4-1 win over their B team to keep up their unbeaten start to the season.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark Suitor produced a dominant performance in frame one defeating Stephen Jackson 68-29 with some sharp potting and clever safety play to put the A team 1-0 up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In frame two Peter O\u2019Hagan delivered a clinical 60-9 victory against Stephen Harrison, including a composed 34 break, as the United A cueist put his side 2-0 in front.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clive Lister edged a thrilling battle on a re-spotted black to beat Jason Flitton 51-44 in frame three, giving United A a commanding 3-0 lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>United B&#8217;s Shane Tallentire was quick to put a stop to the A team\u2019s onslaught as he defeated Tony Hindmoor 55-28 in frame four to pull back to 3-1.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the final frame of the match Andrew Mitchelhill sealed the victory with a&nbsp; composed 58-42 win over Adam Sowden to extend the United A&#8217;s winning margin to 4-1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>United Club A remain firmly top of Division One on 24 points.

Then when he went to put in the rebound he slipped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reds had been the better side for a large part of the second-half but couldn\u2019t turn that possession superiority into goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They had turned round a goal behind but had the tonic of an early equaliser when a Matty Clarke cross evaded everyone to find the Rylands net.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An unmarked header from Matthew Regan at a corner had given the home side a 38<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;minute lead and Jake Burton grabbed the 76<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;minute winner with a well-placed shot into the top corner from 18 yards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can hear Mark Fell\u2019s thoughts on the game below:</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1985610995&#038;color=%23ff5500&#038;auto_play=false&#038;hide_related=false&#038;show_comments=true&#038;show_user=true&#038;show_reposts=false&#038;show_teaser=true\"></iframe><div style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;\"><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/cumbria-crack\" title=\"Cumbria Crack\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\">Cumbria Crack</a> \u00b7 <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/cumbria-crack/mark-fell-after-warrington-rylands-defeat\" title=\"Mark Fell after Warrington Rylands defeat\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\">Mark Fell after Warrington Rylands defeat</a></div>\n",

It will see the creation of a space focused on outdoor activities, free-to-access trails and an opportunity to camp overnight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Council leader Jonathan Brook previously said: \u201cThis is a tremendously exciting project. I am delighted to see the revised proposals reflecting the views and feedback of the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis will be a special place for people to experience and enjoy Earnse Bay. It will also create a hub and base for exploration of the wider Walney area and its unique natural environment.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Earnse Hub project is funded by \u00a32.64 million from the Brilliant Barrow Town Deal which consists of a number of schemes funded by the Government to help the town and its communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The site currently consists of grassland and scrub, with a redundant changing room building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the proposals the area will be transformed to host a community caf\u00e9 building with supporting functions such as a local shop, flexible spaces and toilet facilities for the park, as well as a camping support building serving the family and group camping area.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"519\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/camping-barn-.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-322801\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/camping-barn-.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/camping-barn--300x152.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/camping-barn--768x389.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/camping-barn--260x132.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">An artist&#8217;s impression of the camping barn and cafe </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>However, the plans have received objections from some West Shore residents who raise concerns about noise from the proposed camping facilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One objector stated: \u201cThere are other pockets of derelict land on the Island which would be more suitable for this development away from vulnerable, retired people who bought their properties to live the rest of their lives in a peaceful setting, and not to be surrounded by a scheme that could have devastating consequences for them.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Planning documents submitted with the application say: \u201cIt was explained that the proposed camping had been relocated further from the West Shore Park residents following comments at earlier public consultation meetings.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The council added margins between West Shore Park residential properties and the park areas have been set aside as wildflower meadows or scrub planting to act as a buffer between park activities and quiet residential areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plans also include an environmental education centre which is being delivered by Natural England.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The centre will provide workshops, classrooms, and meeting rooms whilst serving as a volunteer and operational hub for the Natural England team based at North Walney National Nature Reserve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall planting has been chosen to enhance biodiversity on the site, by providing new hedgerow habitats, and more mixed scrub and grasslands well suited to attract and support house sparrow, common lizard and other species.</p>\n",

Red Marshall missed from directly in front of the sticks to let Workington off the extra two points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point Workington changed the game plan and played a constant pick and go game in the forwards, with the backs playing a totally flat line in attack and defence until they had managed to muscle their way into the Ambleside 22.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At half time Ambleside made a couple of changes but Workington stuck to their tried and tested game plan from the end of the first half. Both teams began to get frustrated, and Ambleside conceded two quick penalties that the Workington fly half Brandon Walker converted beautifully to edge the Zebras ahead 6-5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This seemed to bring Ambleside to their senses and again they began to throw the ball out to the backs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sustained pressure on the Workington line finally resulted in Josh Wright-Stevenson crashing over for what was the winning try to Ambleside at 10-6.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ambleside-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-334024\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ambleside-1.jpg 640w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ambleside-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ambleside-1-219x146.jpg 219w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Picture: Clare Geldart Photography</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In the forwards Cunningham, Robinson, Bayliss and Bramwell stood out and a special mention must go to the Ambleside wingers who for the first time this season helped shore up the defence and play the full eighty minutes without the home team conceding a single try.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A massive shout out to all the players and supporters who travelled from Workington. It was such a close game which could have gone either way up to the final minute. Ambleside are very much look forward to the return game next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If only 12 months ago someone would have told the Ambleside executive committee that at the halfway stage of the Cumbria One league at Christmas 2025 the team would be above Aspatria 2s, Workington and local rivals Windermere nobody would have believed them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Centurions now get a deserved rest for a couple of weeks over Christmas and all eyes will be on the return game just down the road with friends and neighbours Windermere on January 18.</p>\n",

This situation is not operationally and economically sustainable.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The accommodation block would consist of seven single occupancy units, each with an en suite and a kitchenette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be built in the northern end of the existing car park at the Travellers Rest Inn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it gets the go-ahead, it means that a nearby bungalow, Ghylburn, could be occupied by a dedicated management couple to run the inn and would lead to the employment of four extra members of staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plans said: \u201cIt has, thus, become fundamental that the provision of subsidised accommodation to a high standard, is made as part of a package not only to attract and retain staff but also to appeal to the calibre of staff that are needed to properly serve the business and, in the process, enhance the overall guest experience in terms of the quality of the food and service provided.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The planning application is under consideration by the authority. </p>\n",

This process will be weather-dependent and can only be undertaken when the wind speed is below 7m per second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the size of the crane, the work is clearly visible across the cityscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Approximately 200 tonnes of RAAC concrete will be removed from the project and delivered in 20 tonne wagons to a local recycling yard where it will be crushed and mixed in to make ballast for future construction projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cumberland Council is aiming to have the roof works completed by late spring 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Internal improvements will then be completed over the summer followed by a&nbsp;new full programme of events starting in autumn 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Preparatory work to replace the Sands Centre, Carlisle RAAC auditorium roof started in September.&nbsp;Carlisle-based contractor Cubby Construction Ltd are undertaking the works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leader of Cumberland Council, councillor Mark Fryer, said: &#8220;This is a significant milestone for the project, and it is great to see work well underway. The Sands is the region\u2019s premier venue and the investment in the new roof and the works planned for the auditorium, will ensure it is the venue of choice for our residents and wider audiences.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the temporary closure of the auditorium last year, GLL, who manage the venue on the council\u2019s behalf moved their classical concert programme to the sports hall within The Sands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the removal and replacement of the RAAC panels, the council is also undertaking some additional internal improvements to the auditorium including a full replacement of the customer seating and upgrades to the back of house facilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the roof replacement, several associated works will also be carried out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These include upgrading the ventilation system (which involves visually altering the roof profile by removing the plenums), enhancing the lighting system, and upgrading the fire alarm system.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the roof access will be improved to facilitate future maintenance of the equipment located on the roof.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The temporary closure of the events space to allow the works to be undertaken does not impact on the day to day running of the main leisure centre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new main Sands Centre building\u2019s leisure provision is unaffected, which includes the pools, gym, studios and sports hall.</p>\n",

The more the better,\u201d said Kirkup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Northern League action in Cumbria starts tonight with a derby clash at Parkside Road as Penrith travel to take-on Kendal Town.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite no football last week-end Penrith boss Darren Edmondson has an injury crisis and could be up to seven players missing tonight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kendal, however, will be in no mood to sympathise as they look to re-ignite their play-off challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The game is being sponsored by the Carlisle United South Cumbria Supporters Club, not the first time they have helped out the Mintcakes,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Pitching In NPL Premier Division Workington Reds travel to Warrington Rylands with manager Mark Fell looking to follow-up his side\u2019s spirited performance against leaders Macclesfield two weeks ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week\u2019s home game with Blyth Spartans was postponed and Reds have the Rylands game plus one at Lancaster on December 21 before they can sample home comforts on Boxing Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Blyth game will be fitted in now on March 8 when hopefully the weather will be a lot calmer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reds have never beaten Rylands in five previous meetings and manager Fell will be aware that their hosts have produced some of their best results in the FA Trophy, notably a win at Scunthorpe United.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fell has seen his lengthy injury list gradually decrease but he has already insisted that nobody will be rushed back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Skipper Dav Symington and defender Jordan Little might make the squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only three players are currently not training \u2013 David Norris, Aran Fitzpatrick and Tyler Beck. Tom Wilkinson has done two sessions so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHopefully it\u2019s not going to be too long before I\u2019ve a few headaches on team selection,\u201d said Fell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the North West Counties League North Division Holker Old Boys have a good opportunity to progress their play-off ambitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They host bottom side Skelmersdale United whose tumble through the pyramid structure shows no sign of halting. They only have a win and two draws from 21 League games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the West Lancashire League Cleator Moor Celtic are at home to Hurst Green while Whitehaven will try again to fit in their Richardson Cup game at Turton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Wearside League fifth in the table Windscale will aim to collect maximum points from a home game against a Richmond Town side who are 17 points behind in 11<sup>th</sup>, albeit with three games in hand.</p>\n",

Control orders were put in place in the county, however, and two men from West Cumbria were jailed for sharing offensive material on Facebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heggie was arrested and interviewed by police in early August.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHe said that his channel had recently obtained an extra 7,000 followers, taking those who follow him up to 45,000,\u201d Mr Evans told the court, \u201cand said that one of his videos had had nearly 500,000 views; because videos of course can be circulated and be seen by who do not necessarily subscribe.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When brought to court, Heggie initially denied a charge he faced. Earlier this month, he admitted an offence or sending communication of an offensive nature. This was brought under the Malicious Communications Act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his sentencing hearing this morning, it emerged Heggie had 32 previous crimes to his name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This included a 2006 conviction for a sexual offence, public order, assaulting a police officer and, in 2013, a racially aggravated public order crime. On that occasion, he had turned up at an address and made a racist comment to the occupant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heggie\u2019s YouTube offences in early August came just weeks after he was given a community order by a Scottish court for dangerous driving. He had struck traffic cones and narrowly avoided hitting two road workers during a wild police chase on Tayside while behind the wheel of a BMW.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tariq Khawam, mitigating today, spoke of Heggie\u2019s mental health issues and branded his offences \u201cstupid\u201d.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHe has had time to reflect while in custody (on remand),\u201d said Mr Khawam. \u201cHe knows what he did was wrong, ill-informed and potentially dangerous.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judge Nicholas Barker noted that Heggie, of Welsh Road, Carlisle, had not been charged with an \u201cincitement\u201d offence. \u201cWhat was clear in your mind was that these statements were to have a broad reach, and to be read and heard by many,\u201d said the judge. \u201cThat\u2019s what you hoped for. That\u2019s what you believed.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou did so at a time of great unrest and concern. It is clear the messages were intended by you to be grossly offensive, particularly to those of a Muslim faith,\u201d added Judge Barker. \u201cYou knew why you were doing it. You knew when you were doing it.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heggie \u2014 remanded in custody since August \u2014 was given a 46-week jail term and told by the judge this meant he would serve 40 per cent of that behind bars.</p>\n",

We also know that patients who are cared for at home have a reduced risk of\u00a0physical deconditioning and functional decline which is particularly important to me, coming from a physiotherapy background\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of Virtual Wards also allows hospitals to keep beds free for those who are sick enough to require a hospital admission, which is vital during the winter months when the we typically see a rise in hospital admissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patients who have received care through the virtual ward said they valued the service and have benefited from being cared for in this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeanette Hodges, 58, from Egremont, was a patient on the Respiratory Virtual Ward following a lower respiratory tract infection.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"295\" height=\"498\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Jeanette-Hodges-VW.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-333741\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Jeanette-Hodges-VW.jpg 295w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Jeanette-Hodges-VW-178x300.jpg 178w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Jeanette-Hodges-VW-86x146.jpg 86w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 295px) 100vw, 295px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Jeanette Hodges </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Jeanette said:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m really happy with the level of support and care I received from the team on the Virtual Ward, they couldn\u2019t have done enough for me. I returned home from hospital to find all the equipment I would need was already waiting for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I was also told if my symptoms worsened there was no need for me to ring an ambulance or go to A&amp;E I would be seen by one of the team right away, which is a huge relief for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I much prefer to be cared for in this way at home and the team have been so attentive, I can\u2019t praise them enough.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kate added: \u201cFor Jeanette we were able to facilitate an early discharge, managing her condition at home, during that time she began with flu \u2013like symptoms which we were able to manage via the Virtual Ward and prevent a readmission to hospital, something I know was a huge relief to Jeanette.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maria Parsonage respiratory consultant nurse at NCIC said: \u201cThe virtual ward has been a great asset to the Trust, local people, and their families. They support people to live well in the comfort and familiarity of their own home whilst receiving the care they need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Since they were launched over 590 patients have been supported by the Virtual Wards and we\u2019re delighted to be part of their continued success.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NCIC are exploring other opportunities for Virtual wards to be used to support other services and hope to be able to roll this out further in the future.&nbsp;</p>\n",

We hope they put a smile on everyone\u2019s face and get people in the mood for Christmas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur customers\u2019 needs and travel habits are different over the holiday period so we change our timetables to respond to that.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buses operate to a Saturday timetable on Monday December 23, Tuesday 24, Friday 27, Monday 30, Tuesday 31, Thursday January 2 and Friday 3. The only exception is the 530 Kendal to Cartmel, which has a normal weekday service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Christmas Eve and New Year\u2019s Eve buses wind-down early with most services finishing by 7pm. However, some later journeys operate on the 79/179 from Carlisle to Dumfries and the 104 Carlisle to Penrith and Center Parcs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no buses on Christmas Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Boxing Day, special timetables apply on the 61, 67 and 104 in Carlisle, the 30, 300 and X5 in West Cumbria, the 555 and 599 in the Lakes, the 1 and 3 in Barrow and the 1A, 2X, 6A, 41, 55 and 100 in Lancaster. No other routes run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only services on New Year\u2019s Day are the 555 between Kendal and Keswick and the 599 Bowness to Grasmere, which operate special timetables.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Normal Saturday and Sunday times apply over the weekend December 28/29.</p>\n",

We fully expect him to be pushing for a position in the main body of the team.\u201d</p>\n",

I\u2019d also like to thank our local Maternity Voices Partnership for their ongoing support and guidance.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Janet Gorry, bay-wide maternity and neonatal voices partnership lead, said: \u00a0&#8220;I am delighted that the midwife-led birth services at Helme Chase are being relaunched, and 24 hours\u00a0home birth services will be fully available from January 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The dedication from midwifes across Morecambe Bay has been outstanding, their commitment to deliver safe and effective maternity care has ensured the longer-term stability of Helme Chase for the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I would like to take this opportunity to thank them on behalf of all the parents and new mums to be who have supported the reopening of the midwife-led birth services and home births across Morecambe Bay.\u201d</p>\n",

The survey will remain open until Friday, 31 January.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The council is hoping to gather opinions of the parking options in both locations, users\u2019 reasons for using the car parks, value for money, how sites could be improved and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The information gathered will help inform the council as it develops a parking strategy; looking at how it can best manage and use the car parking assets it owns as well as provide the necessary parking required in different locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cumberland Council took over the off-street car parking sites previously managed by Allerdale Borough Council, Carlisle City Council, Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council as part of local government reorganisation in April 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Councillor Barbara Cannon, executive member for financial planning and assets, said: \u201cCar parking is a really important subject for many people; especially for residents, businesses and visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A well-managed car park can not only help effectively manage traffic in our town and city centres, but also help provide valuable space for residents to park to do their shopping and access vital services, and provide a proper space for visitors to leave their cars while enjoying what Cumberland has to offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs Cumberland, we inherited a number of car parks across the district, and we now want to develop a long-term strategy on how best to use these sites. The results of the surveys will help shape those plans and I\u2019d encourage as many people as possible to take part.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To take part in the surveys, go to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"http://bit.ly/KeswickCarParkSurvey\">Keswick Car Park Survey </a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://bit.ly/CarlisleCarParkSurvey\">Carlisle Car Park Survey</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

I think they\u2019ll be useful at our\u00a0club. We have fun here and I\u2019ve made new friends too.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The association has also bought laptops and educational software with its grant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chairwoman\u00a0Vivienne Tregidga said: \u201cTo the dyslexic child, reading is not a pleasure, it\u2019s a difficult chore\u00a0that causes them stress and anxiety. This is why we set up our Saturday Hubs to help these\u00a0children from an early age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We make learning to read fun and give them the strategies to\u00a0help them deal with their dyslexia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe C-Pens are a pen-like device that when drawn across text reads it out to the user. It&nbsp;can also spell out the word for easier understanding. These pens help us teach children who&nbsp;have come to us a bit later and are already word blind\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The association\u00a0runs the popular Saturday Hubs in Seascale, Maryport and Carlisle. It also offers\u00a0advice and support for parents and teachers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hubs, which are regularly oversubscribed, offer each participating child an\u00a0individual programme according to their needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activities include reading, phonics and\u00a0spelling games, individualised computer programs, and other educational games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finn\u2019s dad, Norman Black, said his son had \u2018come on leaps and bounds\u2019 at the club. \u201cFinn\u2019s&nbsp;really&nbsp;enjoyed it and it has helped us see what extra support is available.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mum Samantha Cook, whose daughter Robyn has recently started attending the Saturday\u00a0morning sessions, described the sessions as a God send.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: &#8220;It has shown us that there are\u00a0resources that can help children like Robyn, and it is good to meet the other parents to\u00a0support each other.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Linda McMillan, chief people officer at Fibrus, said: \u201cBringing people together both digitally,\u00a0and via community connections, is at the heart of what we do.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are delighted to be able to support organisations like WCDA across the county through&nbsp;our Community Fund. The WCDA volunteers have so much experience and knowledge, and</p>\n\n\n\n<p>their work makes such a difference to children affected by dyslexia. It\u2019s rewarding to know&nbsp;that our fund has enabled children in Cumbria to receive additional support with reading.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fibrus, in partnership with Cumbria Foundation, set up the Community Fund Cumbria in April&nbsp;2023 to help address digital poverty with a particular focus on older and younger people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Affiliated to the British Dyslexia Association, WCDA has been running for more than 30&nbsp;years and, as well as Saturday Hubs, offers a helpline, a befriending service and regular&nbsp;events for parents and teachers.</p>\n",

While some families created magical memories, many experienced disappointment and parking challenges. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And it seems our elves were a bit too enthusiastic with their hiding spots &#8211; we&#8217;ll make sure they&#8217;re more visitor-friendly next time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A mismanagement of planning and ticket allocations led to safety concerns during Sunday&#8217;s event, where more vehicles turned up than expected per ticket. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We failed to anticipate these issues, and that&#8217;s on us. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In light of these safety concerns, we&#8217;ve had to make the difficult decision to cancel the Elf Hunt scheduled for December 14. All ticket holders have been contacted directly with full details and refund information. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re already implementing changes to ensure future events are safer and better organised. We value our community and love holding larger events for you all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We look forward to welcoming you back when we can provide the magical and safe experiences your family deserve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Many of you have gone out of your way to share your positive experience of the event. We are grateful for the encouragement and want to thank all who have shared their feedback, both positive and negative. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Needless to say, our original communications regarding the poor experience many of you received still stands and we have learnt valuable lessons on how to improve these types of events for all in the future.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

The park is large so why is the stage frequently set up opposite residents. I cannot understand.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a redacted objection, one resident said the area was subject to incidents of vandalism, fighting and anti-social behaviour from groups of young people drinking in the park.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They added: \u201cWe believe Vulcan Park to be totally unsuitable for this kind of event and there are other places in town they could hold it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere is no way that hundreds of young adults drinking alcohol for seven hours are going to go home quietly once the music stops and how safe are the children using the playground going to be?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr and Mrs Graham from Queen Street also felt the area was prone to young people drinking and anti-social behaviour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The applicant said alcohol would only be provided within a contained bar area during the course of the event. Staff would be trained and the Challenge 25 policy would be in operation for customers to prevent underage alcohol sales. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> An event management plan would be submitted a minimum of 20 weeks before the festival date and SIA Security would be employed throughout the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cumbria police has raised no objections. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mediation discussion were attempted with the interested parties, but all felt their representations should be considered by the regulatory sub-committee.</p>\n",

The cordon now runs from Avanti to Lunesdale Home and Gardens on the opposite side of the street. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>People are asked not to go beyond the cordon area as there are still a number of structurally unsafe buildings and heavy machinery operating in the area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A community support centre has been established at St Mary\u2019s Church. It is manned by local volunteers from 9am to 5pm daily with support from Westmorland and Furness Council officers.\u00a0Anyone unable to visit in person can call 015242 36404.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shop Small is offering Kirkby Lonsdale businesses impacted by the fire and Christmas Market stall holders affected by the cancellation of the event an opportunity to trade at a Late Night Shop Small event at Junction 36 Auction Mart at Crooklands next Wednesday, December 18, from 6pm to 8pm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Affected businesses can attend for free. Entry is also free for anyone wanting to go along and it would be wonderful if people could support these local businesses at this most difficult time</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Go Fund Me page has been set up by Lunesdale Hall (Institute) charitable trust working with Kirkby Lonsdale Community Recovery Partnership and Cumbria Community Foundation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone wishing to donate can do so at <a href=\"https://gofund.me/3425db8f\">https://gofund.me/3425db8f</a></p>\n",

If you have private CCTV or doorbell cameras, we would like you to register these with us so we can build a full picture of where cameras are across our county.<br><br>\u201cThe registration process is quick, simple and there is no additional cost.\u201d<br><br>In registering a CCTV or doorbell camera, the owner continues to have full ownership of the footage and Cumbria Constabulary does not have access to these cameras. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon identifying a camera of interest, officers will send a request to the owner for them to review their footage to see if this holds evidence pertinent to the case.<br><br>Supt Skelton added: \u201cThis game-changing mapping functionality enables our officers to identify pre-registered cameras which may be of interest, it does not enable our officers to access this data without the owner\u2019s permission.<br><br>\u201cVideo footage can be crucial in establishing the full circumstances of an allegation. By accelerating our potential CCTV enquiries, we will be able to achieve positive outcomes for victims of crime much quicker.<br><br>\u201cCumbria Constabulary is adopting technologies and data platforms to enhance public engagement, increase efficiency, and strengthen our communities today and for the future.\u201d<br><br>Cumbria\u2019s Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner David Allen said: \u201cCCTV is already a fantastic tool to help the police investigate crimes and potentially identify criminals. This is an incredible extension to the technology.<br><br>\u201cThe addition of this will help expand our system and help catch criminals. I would encourage anyone or any business with CCTV or video doorbells to register with the constabulary.<br><br>\u201cI want to make it clear: this isn\u2019t a tool to spy on law-abiding members of the public. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Registering your camera simply makes the police aware that you have equipment that records footage. If a crime happens in your area, the police will ask for permission to view the footage \u2013 they have no way to access it without the owner\u2019s permission.<br><br>\u201cYou could help tackle crime in your area simply by registering \u2013 it\u2019s a brilliant tool and together we can all protect Cumbria.\u201d<br><br>To register your CCTV or doorbell camera, please visit:\u00a0<a href=\"https://track.vuelio.uk.com/z.z?l=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jb25uZWN0Y3VtYnJpYS5jby51aw%3d%3d&amp;r=14765409342&amp;d=24637300&amp;p=1&amp;t=h&amp;h=ca8eb2288a8a4f51ac3c7f28ffad62ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">www.connectcumbria.co.uk</a>.</p>\n",

You can play all the good football, you can pass it around but in big moments and big games that&#8217;s when it&#8217;s won or lost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I thought from a youth game of football, I think both teams come out with a fair bit of credit. I think both teams gave absolutely everything and made a good game of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You really cannot fault the lads but I&#8217;d say both teams as well, you&#8217;ve got to give them a bit of credit for the distance they&#8217;ve travelled and I thought it was a good game of youth football.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He went on: &#8220;It&#8217;s all about development for these lads. It&#8217;s all about learning and having them winning and losing feelings and taking it forward into the career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The under-16s have come in and done themselves credit but they&#8217;ve got another two years and it stands us in good stead that now we&#8217;ve got some first years coming in next year who&#8217;ve had the ups and downs of Youth Cup football.\u201d</p>\n",

A man in his 40s was pronounced dead at the scene at 6.30am on Sunday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fire caused significant internal and external damage to buildings near Taylors, Save the Children, and Botanica, with unstable walls, unsupported structures, and roof elements posing immediate risks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile Dales Butchers, one of a number of businesses affected, are accepting orders by phone and email and are urging customers to support them and other businesses at a time when trade in the run up to Christmas is normally brisk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kirkby Lonsdale Rugby Union Club is supporting a player originally from New Zealand who lost his home and all his belongings in the fire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Jakob is far from home and having lost every possession he had, he now needs our community to support him,&#8221; the <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/jakob-needs-your-help-please?utm_campaign=fp_sharesheet&amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;utm_source=copy_link\">fundraising appeal page </a>reads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Even a few pounds can help him start to rebuild his life, and show that in Kirkby Lonsdale and in the wider rugby community no one stands alone.

To lose your home in the same month is an absolute travesty. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Sam and Josh have both said that any funds raised will be shared between everyone involved in the Kirkby Lonsdale street fire, residents who lost their homes, and family members who have lost loved ones.&#8221;</p>\n",

These instructors\u00a0are at the heart of delivering the charity\u2019s objective: providing outdoor adventure breaks to people living with even the most profound disabilities.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The charity said what it had achieved far exceeded the team\u2019s wildest expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Staff, guests, local families and businesses all played their part and highlights included:\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A 24-hour Calvert superhero triathlon where 40 Calvert\u00a0staff, volunteers, guests, trustees, family and friends rode, jived, swam and swung their way through 24 one hour slots to help kickstart fundraising</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Local businesses including\u00a0Booths, Bothy Threads, Pioneer, Keswick Town Council, Friends of Calvert Trust, Edwin Thompson, David Hayton, Holiday Cottages, Air Products, Decking Design, The Gruesomes. Atkinsons, Stoneswood Homes and Verey Books\u00a0all supported incredibly generously</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Individual fundraising efforts were spectacular too! One local family promised to make and give away 500 Portuguese custard tarts in an effort to galvanise friends and family to donate during the week. In the end Sibella, nine, and her dad, Ciso Barbosa made and gave away 690 Pasteis de Nata</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"790\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Calvert-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-333355\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Calvert-2.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Calvert-2-300x231.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Calvert-2-768x593.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Calvert-2-189x146.jpg 189w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\" class=\"wp-block-list\"></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Head of income generation, Helen Archibald said: &#8220;We\u2019re all overwhelmed at the response from our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;These vital funds will help us help more guests find out just what they \u2018can do\u2019 and I\u2019d like to extend a heartfelt thank you to each and every individual and business who supported us.

He was urged not to drive by police 27 days before the crash on the A7 at Stanwix Bank which claimed the life of 50-year-old Neil Errington.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On April 5 2022, Devoy was confronted by angry pedestrians in Carlisle\u2019s West Tower Street after his vehicle mounted a kerb and came to a rest perilously close to people at a bus stop. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devoy was heard revving his immobilised car and later told a PC he believed he had suffered an absent seizure at the wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That PC spoke to Devoy about voluntarily surrendering his driving licence because of the episode. \u201cThe officer warned him not to drive again,\u201d prosecutor Tim Evans told Carlisle Crown Court.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But instead, in the aftermath of that incident, Devoy lied to the DVLA by saying his licence was lost. He then failed to declare his epilepsy when trying to hire a car on April 10. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday May 2, Devoy collected a new BMW 320 from a Carlisle dealership and headed south on to Scotland Road. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He initially collided with and then rammed a Fiat Punto driven by 19-year-old woman who saw the BMW approaching from behind and thought: \u201cI am just going to have to take this.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After multiple impacts, Devoy drove off ludicrously quickly and attracted the attention of several concerned motorists as he headed towards central Carlisle on the wrong side of the road. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was travelling at between 76 and 81mph \u2014 in a 30mph zone \u2014 moments before he ploughed into the back of a southbound Mercedes stationary at traffic lights on Stanwix Bank during another medical episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Driver Mr Errington, of the Carlisle area, was airlifted to a Newcastle hospital where, despite treatment, he died 10 days later after life support was withdrawn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His partner and passenger, Sandra Mallinson, was also injured and likened the shocking collision to a bomb going off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devoy told a PC: \u201cI think I must have had a funny do.\u201d He later admitted causing death by dangerous driving, and two counts of fraud by false representation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As he was sentenced this afternoon, the court heard an impact statement provided by Miss Mallinson, who described her life since the tragedy as a living hell. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: \u201cI struggle to comprehend how the actions of one man has caused me so much pain, stress, worry and loss. To say my life has been irrevocably changed is an understatement. My life as it was before May 2 2022 has been utterly destroyed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDue to the injuries I sustained I\u2019ve lost my livelihood. I spend my days now in a constant state of physical and emotional pain. I have lost who I was. But the most painful thing I have lost which I can never get back, is Neil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNeil and I were together for 14 years and we were in the process of renovating our home to spend the autumn of our lives here, enjoying what we had created together. Our once happy home now stands empty</p>\n\n\n\n<p>with our dreams in tatters, and we will never get to enjoy the life we had been dreaming of together.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A statement from the Punto driver outlined the stress, financial and physical impact on her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Father-of-two Devoy, of Knightswood, Sunderland, wept in the dock as facts of his offending were outlined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Susan Hirst, mitigating, provided personal background information and said: \u201cI would like to start by expressing to Miss Mallinson and Mr Errington\u2019s family how deeply sorry he is for what he has done. He knows that there is nothing that can be said to make up for their loss. He also knows he is entirely responsible for their grief.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imposing a prison sentence of six years eight months, Judge Michael Fanning told Devoy: \u201cIt was you that killed him and you have to live with that. Nothing can bring him back.\u201d </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have been on the road at all and you knew that because of your medical history,\u201d added the judge. \u201cLook what you\u2019ve done. Look what harm you\u2019ve caused. Look what a life you\u2019ve taken.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devoy must serve a 10-year driving ban when released from custody.</p>\n",

When natural light exceeds a programmed threshold that meets the required safety standards, the lighting in those locations will not illuminate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lighting programme ensures the right level of safety and energy savings are being achieved, so lights come on as and when required.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lighting only operates when the area is in use. An annual saving of 42 tonnes of CO2 equivalent has been estimated, as compared with the baseline year of 2019/20. This is the equivalent of planting 3,384 trees and is based on a 63% saving in lighting output.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Councillor Giles Archibald, Westmorland and Furness Council\u2019s cabinet member for climate, biodiversity and environmental services said: \u201cThe predicted levels of savings for both CO2 and energy through this lighting replacement scheme is fantastic and forms just one of several projects that make up our detailed five-year Climate Action Plan.\u00a0 This takes us one step further on our journey to net zero and establishing ourselves as an ecologically aware, climate positive council.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A short video for the project can be viewed here:&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tracking.vuelio.co.uk/tracking/click?d=dow9jTH10r6VMs1DfFzfBGhBkv-6l3xvqtj5yVXYv_geHosTR4KJQPAFT3wvrTQSqnpHSZlp9OuH2J-1haqLFc81Ir4QfeXbmNVf9VDL3PEqCbMiNCRa8f49p-_D_ONKwiMb0jyWJo3XEWPSpQGvcZM1\">https://youtube.com/shorts/zH6CVRbBolI</a>&nbsp;</p>\n",

With nine tries already, Donald is not only six off her total of last season but also banging on the door for Cumbria recognition ahead of next year&#8217;s County Championship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further Workington tries came from Caitlin Jenkinson and Lauren Coulson &#8211; each with two &#8211; with another by captain Juliet Porter, while Donald added two conversions as well as one by Elsa Whelan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the Finches have the league&#8217;s only 100% record, they remain third, three points behind Old Crossleyans but having three games in hand owing to postponements.</p>\n",

I have seen first-hand the amazing skills that people can bring to the classroom through initiatives such as this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cChetwynde School is the only all-through school in the area and, while placements are in primary, the chosen candidates will benefit from all the expertise staff across our entire school and trust can bring.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The places are non-salaried places and are funded through student loans with a guaranteed interview at the end of the course.

I think everybody&#8217;s looking forward to the night and the occasion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFontwell are a very front-foot team, a bit like us to be honest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re expecting a tough game but I think it&#8217;s two teams that seem to be evenly matched but we&#8217;ll see how the night goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI think we&#8217;ve got most people back and there&#8217;s only Will Nicholson who&#8217;s long-term injury now, from there everyone&#8217;s got a clean bill of health so the S&amp;Cs and the physios within the team have done a great job getting them back to not just coming back from injury but maintaining the fitness levels as well.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having found the net in Altrincham and Barnsley in round one and two, respectively, Lewis Lambert is one of many players who could provide a selection headache going into this one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cLewis always gives us headaches for selection because he&#8217;s a good player, but sometimes I don&#8217;t think he believes in what a good player he can be</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEvery time he&#8217;s been called upon he&#8217;s done a great job for the team and he does score goals, not just your normal goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf you get the ball onto his left-foot, he&#8217;s capable of smashing them from anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWith everybody being back now we&#8217;ve got James Murray who&#8217;s been out for a while, we&#8217;ve got Seb Mason who&#8217;s been out for quite a few weeks, Mason Fleming coming back who&#8217;s been out since pre-season, so everybody seems to be coming back at the right time and I&#8217;d say we&#8217;ve got some selection issues.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Blues progressed to this stage with a 4-1 win (AET) against Altrincham, and a 1-0 win at Barnsley.</p>\n",

Pictures: JP Smith Photography</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Workington Town Women produced their most polished performance of the season so far in a 7-0 win at Blackpool Ladies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were hat tricks for Bea Barber and Cassie Donald which crowned their dominant display.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Barber opened the scoring in the 4th minute after centre back Keeley Chatters, played a direct ball to find Nat Broad in space offering on the left.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broad settled before lifting a ball over the home back line to find Barber\u2019s attacking run. Her clean first-time&nbsp;control allowed her to steady and slot the ball home with real authority.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their lead was doubled a little over five minutes later&nbsp;after a drive from Chloe Henderson on the right, ricocheted to find&nbsp;Cassie Donald on the edge of the area. Donald\u2019s crisp strike produced a fine save from the Blackpool shot stopper, Rhianna Moore, with the resulting loose ball finding Broad in support to coolly slot home from close in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With just over the half hour played, Barber\u2019s pace and control punished a misplaced pass from the home defence as she broke free from 40 yards out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good pressing from full back Tiegan Hargrave,&nbsp;stacked pressure on her opposing left back&nbsp;high up the field. Barber sensed the chance as she pressed the attempted connection,&nbsp;before running clear and rounding Moore to slot home into an empty goal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the sides went into the dressing rooms at half-time, and with Town with a three goal cushion, it would seem just&nbsp;to place all plaudits in the direction of the attacking players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the platform had been set by the whole&nbsp;team and from the control and dominance that they had fought to establish over the first 45 minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The back line of Hargrave, Helen Wagstaff, Chatters and Hooper, had quickly found their rhythm and displayed a controlled cohesion between them which was complimented by Laura Miller\u2019s calmness in the visitors\u2019 nets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Industry in the middle of the park from Kirsten Donald, Henderson, Cassie Donald and Hayley Bracken had quickly closed the doors on home desires to attack as well as connecting well to pose&nbsp;a series of attacking questions from themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To put it simply, Town Women had established total control in the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only sour note in the first half from the visitors\u2019 perspective, was when Kirsten Donald had to leave the field having rolled her ankle with only minutes of the half remaining.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeley Holliday replaced Donald and was soon hitting the quality and control that her predecessor had set earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The quality of strikes on goal in the first half was impressive, but the four second half strikes were phenomenal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With less than five minutes of the second half gone, midfielder Cassie Donald notched up the first of her hat trick of goals.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"571\" height=\"326\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Workington-Town-Women.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-333224\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Workington-Town-Women.jpeg 571w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Workington-Town-Women-300x171.jpeg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Workington-Town-Women-256x146.jpeg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Bea Barber helped herself to a hat-trick.

Noting that Moore was off her line, the in-form striker delivered a lofted strike from 25 yards which left the keeper no chance of saving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Barber\u2019s keenness to press was a fundamental factor in Donald\u2019s second goal, as the attacker chased down the home re-start from a goal kick,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the ball was played forward, Broad added a second phase of pressure and her presence was enough to cause the ball to come loose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Donald needed no second invitation as she attacked the loose ball from the left and drilled home the ball with power from 25 yards out to find the bottom left corner. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Donald\u2019s third came as the game was drawing to a close and after persistent physical attention aimed at Bracken throughout had resulted in the attacking midfielder being felled 20 yards out on the right-hand side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Donald was keen to take the opportunity to complete her hat trick and with her resulting driven strike&nbsp;passing&nbsp;Moore at pace, her mission was completed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nat Broad was awarded the Player of the Game recognition for Town Women after a controlled and composed performance in the attacking area of the field for the visitors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the game, manager Paul Mackenzie was keen to credit the victory to the squad performance saying: \u201cWe were in scintillating form and that was quite possibly the most complete team performance that I have seen the squad deliver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere has without doubt, been really good performances in the past, but this was next level stuff. The dominance and control was complemented by keen pressing as a team and the quality of goals just got better and better as the game unfolded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe were concerned to lose Kirsten just before half time as she has been in cracking form this season, but hopefully responding quickly and removing her from the game will result in the damage being minimal and she will be back quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cKeeley came on and ensured that the dominance that Kirsten had set was continued with, as too did fellow substitutes Ella O\u2019Nions and Olivia Paice.\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Town Women will see out their footballing activities for 2024 when they entertain Preston North End at the Fibrus Community Stadium&nbsp;this Sunday at 2pm.</p>\n",

Gerard split the double enterprise and completed a three-day cycling challenge by riding the height of the four highest mountain peaks in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales for Asthma + Lung UK in the first week of July.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Margaret had the lung condition, Bronchiectasis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Faced with the problem of how to follow the Bronchiectasis challenge, and having already climbed the height of Mount Everest during training for the July event, Gerard opted to go for the world\u2019s tallest mountain on Earth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That mountain is Mauna Kea which is a non-active volcano in Hawaii. Although 4,205 metres above sea level its base is 6,000 metres below sea level, giving a total height of 10,205 metres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the July challenge, when he climbed 4,446 metres in three days, a more measured approach was taken and the challenge was completed in October, though 30 metres of climbing was held back for a very special reception.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Headteacher of Whitehaven&#8217;s Jericho Primary School, James Blackwell, had taken a keen interest in the challenge and Gerard had supplied the children of Jericho with weekly updates of his progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final day of riding to the virtual summit of Mauna Kea was held back until after half-term and more than 400 children were assembled within the school grounds to greet Gerard and his two cycling companions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the challenge moral support for Gerard had been given by his long-time friends, Ged Brear a well known local cycling champion and the 1964 Tokyo Olympic rider, multi-World Championship rider and Professional cyclist, Mike Cowley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With support from Jericho Primary School, Myers and Bowman \u2013 Toyota, Cardiosport, Hampshire and family and friends, cash was raised towards research to find a cure for a rare macular genetic condition known as Sorsby Fundus Dystrophy which had affected Margaret for over 40 years in the latter part of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To say thank you to Gerard and all his supporters, a meeting was arranged in the LionsDen Caf\u00e9 on Wey Hill in Haslemere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about Bronchiectasis call Asthma + Lung UK on 0300 222 5800 \u2013\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:helpline@asthmaandlung.org.uk\">helpline@asthmaandlung.org.uk</a>\u00a0and Sorsby Fundus Dystrophy Macular Society on 0300 3030 111\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:help@macularsociety.org\">help@macularsociety.org</a></p>\n",

When you look at what happened to Sycamore Gap, it destroyed a well known view and this is the same, this is our Sycamore Gap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a striking lone tree that stands at the top of these hills in a place called The Todds, which means death in German and it&#8217;s a really old bit of land so there&#8217;s a chance it has quite a bit of history and it shouldn&#8217;t be sacrificed for a mast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a prime Cumbrian view and it needs to be treasured and protected into the future.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"750\" height=\"465\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lone-tree-kendal-plans-one.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-333112\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lone-tree-kendal-plans-one.png 750w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lone-tree-kendal-plans-one-300x186.png 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lone-tree-kendal-plans-one-235x146.png 235w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Picture: Westmorland &amp; Furness Council Planning</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Kendal&#8217;s lone tree sits on the border between Burneside and Kendal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burneside Parish Council was asked for its views on the proposals. It said it had previously opposed any developments in the area, known as Green Gap. It asked Cornerstone why this location had been chosen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cornerstone said: &#8220;The proposed location was selected due to the site&#8217;s elevation, which provides the maximum level of mobile coverage and capacity to the area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Additionally, during the site survey, it was evident that there is a housing development to the south of the proposed cell location. The current coverage is already struggling in this area, and with an increase in the number of dwellings, the coverage will be further stretched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Therefore, the need for a mast in this location to boost coverage will become more apparent once the housing development is completed.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"527\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/louise-easterlow.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-333140\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/louise-easterlow.jpg 960w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/louise-easterlow-300x165.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/louise-easterlow-768x422.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/louise-easterlow-260x143.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Picture: Kendal Lone Tree / Louise Easterlow</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The resident added: &#8220;So many people have memories and even different names for the tree, one family called it Billy&#8217;s tree because they&#8217;d always see it when they went to visit their uncle Billy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;People have known it since their childhoods, so it&#8217;s steeped in history. A 5G tower next to it would be such an eyesore, the area is absolutely beautiful, it&#8217;s only about a mile outside of the Lake District.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not saying no to a mast in general, we&#8217;re just saying it needs to be put somewhere else in a sympathetic way so it doesn&#8217;t ruin that view. We&#8217;ve had a lot of housing development here, so for me I think we should be protecting the land we have.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposed mast would be five metres taller than the tree and would also feature steel fence and supporting cables.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"350\" height=\"421\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/jenny-edlington.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-333139\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/jenny-edlington.jpg 350w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/jenny-edlington-249x300.jpg 249w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/jenny-edlington-121x146.jpg 121w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Picture: Kendal Lone Tree / Jenny Edlington</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Over 50 letters objecting to the plans have now been submitted to the council. Those objecting have highlighted the tree as well-loved by generations of local people and photographers and have expressed strong opposition to its proposed location.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One local resident also claimed that several 16th and 19th century artefacts have also been found in the area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The resident running the Kendal lone tree campaign said the tree has been photographed in a similar way to Sycamore Gap over the years, including during heavy snow, mist, during super moons, starlight and under the Northern Lights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: &#8220;In London, certain locations have a protected view. This should be a protected view. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Everyone on social media is saying this is terrible and showing their photos of it over the years, so it&#8217;s obvious how special it is. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When I come back home from work, my wife picks me up from train and the tree is one of the first things I see and I know I&#8217;m home, and that&#8217;s what it means to people.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plans for the mast have been proposed by Cornerstone as part of its network improvement programme. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The firm said the proposed design of the 5G tower has been chosen to minimise visual impact on the surrounding area while providing the necessary level of coverage and capacity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It added that without the new mast, the existing coverage in the area would struggle to meet customer demand and that customers would not be able to use their smartphones and other handheld devices as intended as it could result in issues like buffering and dropped calls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A public consultation about the plans runs until Thursday December 19.</p>\n",

We would like to cover more parts of the city, but as we are reliant on volunteers there is a limit to what we can do.\u00a0We&#8217;d especially like to thank Kingmoor Park for allowing us to store the sleigh with them when it&#8217;s not in use.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dates and locations of this year\u2019s sleigh runs:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most start at 5.30pm</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Tuesday December 10: Brampton Road</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wednesday December 11: Morton</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Saturday December 14: Wetheral</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sunday December 15: Longtown</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Monday December 16: Botcherby</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tuesday December 17: Currock</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wednesday December 18: Dalston\u00a0</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Thursday December 19: Crindledyke and Cargo</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Friday December 20: Belah\u00a0</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Saturday December 21: Brampton North</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sunday December 22: Brampton South</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Monday December 23: Raffles</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Christmas Eve: Lowry Hill</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The sleigh has already been out in recent weeks supporting Carlisle Foodbank at Morrisons and at the Brampton Christmas lights switch-on.&nbsp;</p>\n",

Firefighters bravely entered and were initially unsure whether anyone was inside. They were able to make contact with the occupant in Blackpool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an impact statement the man said: \u201cI cannot even begin to put into words how much this crime has impacted me and my family. I find it hard to imagine what would have happened if me and my daughter had been inside the house.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His daughter suffered nightmares in the aftermath. \u201cShe has had to cope with seeing all her teddy bears and toys burned which is completely heartbreaking. The whole experience feels surreal,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThat home that we both knew and loved has been completely burnt out. Me and my daughter literally had the clothes we were wearing and the items we went to Blackpool with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The financial impact, the man also said, had been phenomenal, as there was no insurance for damage to items inside the house which amounted to tens of thousands of pounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Renard later told police he had gone there to confront the man and been frustrated he was not present.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHe stated he was going in there just to create havoc,\u201d said prosecutor Tariq Khawam of Renard, who described taking 10 Valium tablets beforehand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Renard had been candid with police. He admitted arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered, and also burglary. He asked for other matters, including three separate burglaries, to be taken into consideration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A barrister representing Renard said he was remorseful for what he had done, and was not in a rational state of mind at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judge Nicholas Barker concluded that heavily-convicted Renard, previously of Brampton Old Road, Carlisle, should be formally deemed a dangerous offender who posed a risk of causing harm to the public by committing serious future offences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Renard was given a six-year prison sentence, of which he must serve at least two-thirds before being considered for parole, and an extended two-year licence period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt is clear, in my judgement, this was an act of retribution by you towards (the man) to, as it were, inflict harm upon him because of your perceived aggravation,\u201d Judge Barker told him.</p>\n",

The howling gale was blowing pretty much straight down the pitch and West choose to play against the elements in the first half. Carlisle had some early pressure, but the West defence held firm and by retaining possession well in the tight, worked their way into the visitors half.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a feature of the game for both sides as it was a day for up the jumper and minimising the mistakes!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of penalties saw West in the Carlisle 22, and close forward play saw them squeeze over close to the sticks for the first score from centre Conor McLurg, close enough for the conversion to go over despite the wind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of the half saw Carlisle press hard for a score, but struggling to cope with the elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of times they had a chance to drive over but the last pass went astray, and the chance literally slipped away. A long range penalty from Robbi James reduced the arrears to 7-3, but a second effort fell short and half time arrived without any further score.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The game was effectively settled in the first 10 minutes of the second half.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A box kick from the back of a ruck was chased down, hacked on and West winger Max Painter won the touchdown race.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"712\" height=\"470\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Bill-Glendinning-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-333088\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Bill-Glendinning-1.jpg 712w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Bill-Glendinning-1-300x198.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Bill-Glendinning-1-221x146.jpg 221w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Picture: Bill Glendinning.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A West break saw them back in the Carlisle 22 where they encamped and managed to retain possession for flanker Robinson to burrow over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then a fourth try came following a break from full back Siddle, with a chip and chase which he was prevented from scoring illegally and a penalty try awarded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The game looked out of reach for Carlisle even though they had fought hard throughout. Heads could have dropped as the conditions were worsening, but magnificently they did not and the visitors lifted their game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jason Israel marshalled a series of drives and at one point even managed a sweeping backs move into the biting gale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A chip, a chase and full back Jake Whittaker was unlucky not to score, knocking on as he chased down in the dead ball area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carlisle continued to press and finally got the try their effort deserved, after series of forward drives saw Josh Holmes burrow over and James added a conversion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carlisle continued to press, made one last huge effort and were once more in the hosts 22.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But West defended resolutely and eventually won a penalty to clear their lines. By this point the weather had further worsened and both sets of players were cold and exhausted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The referee agreed with both skippers that continuing further was pointless and the game was abandoned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As they had passed the hour mark, the result will stand and the match does not need to be replayed.</p>\n",

She is usually kept as a static display in the\u00a0Ravenglass Railway Museum\u00a0and is only brought out and steamed on special events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The preparations come ahead of a celebratory programme of 150th\u00a0anniversary events for the railway, which will get underway with\u00a0a Whistle Off on January 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other key celebrations to mark Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway\u2019s major milestone will include a special steam gala with visiting engines and the unveiling of a newly refurbished electric locomotive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A full list of events will be unveiled in the new year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The celebrations also coincide with Railway 200 \u2013 a year-long nationwide campaign to celebrate 200 years of railways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Operations manager, Keith Herbert said: \u201c150 years ago the original Ravenglass &amp; Eskdale Railway \u2013 known as the Owd Ratty\u2013 was under construction, before it opened in 1875. While we\u2019re not building a railway this time around, we are renewing part of the track to keep the La\u2019al Ratty alive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEchoing the work of a century-and-a-half prior, Katie has been moving materials for this winter\u2019s track renewals in Mill Wood, scheduled to take place in January. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The unloading of the materials has been assisted greatly by some of our wonderful volunteers, who will help us reach our 150-year milestone.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The La&#8217;al Ratty was forced to cancel its Santa Express trains on Saturday due to Storm Darragh and the company said it was meeting to see what was possible for the customers affected. </p>\n",

There\u2019s no association between toxic dose and the weight of your pet so any amount is significant.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"onions-garlic-and-related-vegetables\">Onions, garlic, and related vegetables</h3>\n\n\n<p>These common household ingredients are toxic both cooked and uncooked.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"alcohol\">Alcohol</h3>\n\n\n<p>Consumption can result in dizziness, vomiting, depression and breathing difficulties.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"xylitol\">Xylitol</h3>\n\n\n<p>A sweetener commonly found in Christmas treats like candy canes, as well as in some brands of peanut butter and baked goods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is mistaken as real sugar by the pancreas, making it release more insulin and causing your pets\u2019 blood sugar level to drop. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Signs of hypoglycaemia include lethargy, vomiting, tremors, unsteadiness and loss of consciousness.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"moulds\">Moulds</h3>\n\n\n<p>Moulds, including those found in blue cheese and uneaten leftovers, produce spores that are toxic to animals. Make sure to keep bin bags away from inquisitive pets.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"bones\">Bones</h3>\n\n\n<p>The classic combination of a dog and a bone is best saved for nursery rhymes and cartoon strips. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cooked bones can easily splinter, risking damage to the digestive tract and sometimes cause blockages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uncooked bones could be contaminated with food poisoning bacteria like salmonella, causing nasty tummy upsets as a minimum.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"macadamia-nuts\">Macadamia nuts</h3>\n\n\n<p>Consumption can result in weakness and depression.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fatty-foods\">Fatty foods</h3>\n\n\n<p>Although not technically toxic, fatty foods can cause digestive upset or even lead to pancreatitis which is very painful.</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-can-i-give-my-pet-as-a-treat-this-christmas\">What can I give my pet as a treat this Christmas?</h2>\n\n\n<p>Plenty of foods are safe to share with your pets \u2013 think lean cooked meats, carrots, peas, and well-cooked potatoes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, decorations can present a choking hazard and changes in routine, including guests staying in the house, can be stressful for our pets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to keep decorations and presents out of reach and create a routine that works for you and your pet to help them release any pent-up energy during the festivities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019d like to wish you all a very merry Christmas and if you do have any concerns over your pet\u2019s health during the festive period, do not hesitate to contact your vet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We at Rowcliffe House are available 24 hours a day and are always happy to help.</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pets-arent-just-for-christmas\">Pets aren&#8217;t just for Christmas</h2>\n\n\n<p>As a practice, and as part of the veterinary profession, we strive to deliver the message that pets are for life, never just for Christmas. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you are bringing a new pet home this winter, consider signing up to our Pet Care Health Plan to save money on routine parasite treatments, routine vaccines, and neutering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please go to <a href=\"https://rowcliffehousevets.co.uk/pets/pet-care-health-scheme/\">www.rowcliffehousevets.co.uk/pets/pet-care-health-scheme</a> or call us on 01768 865661 to find out more.</p>\n",

Passers-by stopped to help and officers were alerted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McPherson\u2019s partner arrived on scene with first the handbag \u2014 minus its contents \u2014 and then shortly after the woman\u2019s mobile phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McPherson was identified as the robber and had committed the robbery to pay off a drug debt and buy alcohol, it emerged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an impact statement, the woman told how her husband had died 18 months earlier. They had previously worked together at Carlisle\u2019s Pirelli factory, although she later found herself unable to remain there. She instead found work as a cleaner and was on her way to a new job, carrying identity documents, but had not been able to take that position in the aftermath of the robbery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt required her to work and travel between four and eight in the morning,\u201d observed Judge Nicholas Barker. \u201cThe trauma of being on the street at that time of the morning, on her own, in the dark, meant she lost all her confidence.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that the woman now had was her dog. And she said of McPherson: \u201cI just feel like he has taken everything off me. Even when I am in the house now I double-check that all my doors are locked. I am too scared to even open the windows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI just can\u2019t believe he did this right next to the police station.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McPherson, now of Newtown Close, Carlisle, admitted robbery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Barrister Kim Whittlestone, mitigating, said heavily-convicted McPherson had been out of trouble since 2018 but relapsed into an alcohol addiction earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A probation service pre-sentence report detailed trauma he had witnessed as a child, and of his subsequent vulnerability and manipulation by others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHe did not target this lady,\u201d said Miss Whittlestone. \u201cHe did not know who she was. He is remorseful for that and would wish for his apologies to be passed on to her.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judge Barker imposed an immediate 32-month jail term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe nature of these random attacks is that you do not know and cannot know the circumstances of the person you are about to rob,\u201d said the judge.&nbsp;\u201cThey may be very strong and resilient or they may not be. Because of the very sad sequence of events in her (the victim\u2019s) life, she was not resilient.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McPherson was also banned from contacting the woman for five years.</p>\n",

place the Eric McMullen Memorial TKO Handicap Trophy stage 3 qualifying produced some thrilling encounters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the opening Cup game of the week Workington Veterans Club B delivered their most impressive performance of the tournament so far, dismantling United Club B with a remarkable 6-1 scoreline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wayne Sinclair (Handicap 39) set the tone for Vets B in frame one with a commanding 58-21 win over Stephen Harrison (38) to put the home side 1-0 up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frame two saw Adam Hodgson (45) extend the Vets B lead to 2-0 with a clinical 69-55 victory over Stephen Jackson (35).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first doubles frame, Jordan Ferguson and Paul Johnston (50) worked seamlessly to overcome Shane Tallentire and Stephen Harrison (42), earning a 55-42 win for a 3-0 Vets B advantage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wayne Sinclair and Adam Hodgson (43) continued the Vets B&#8217;s doubles dominance with an 82-45 victory over Stephen Jackson and Andrew Carter (40) to extend to 4-0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In frame five Jordan Ferguson (50) featured in singles action this time, defeating Andrew Carter (45) 42-19 with a composed display to put Vets B 5-0 up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vets B&#8217;s Lewis Straughton (45) produced an exceptional performance, defeating Adam Sowden (46) 56-46 in a nail-biting encounter that moved the score to 6-0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last frame of the contest did offer some consolation for United B, however, as Shane Tallentire (45) produced a polished performance to defeat Simon Tootle (45) 59-15 and end the match 6-1 in Vets B&#8217;s favour.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next Cup match, Station Road played brilliantly to overpower current Division One league champions Workington Golf Club A with a resounding 5-2 victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first Tom Thompson (22) kicked things off for Station Road with a composed 65-28 win over Phil Sorfleet (14), setting the tone for the visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin Kirkham (scratch) put on a masterclass in frame two, defeating reigning singles champion Ryan Ismay (10) 91-27 in a confident and clinical display for a 2-0 Station Road lead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first doubles frame saw Station Road&#8217;s Tom Thompson and Kevin Kirkham (11) deliver a commanding 68-28 victory over Brian Walker and Mark Cowan (19), with Kirkham contributing a stunning break of 35 to make it 3-0.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Workington Golf Club fought back in the second doubles frame as Mark Brasted and Ryan Ismay (24) secured a high-scoring 82-72 win over Darren Lawson and John Teasdale (42), keeping the hosts in contention at 3-1.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The singles returned in frame five as Mike Walker (22) restored Station Road\u2019s dominance with a focused 60-35 win over Mark Brasted (14), giving the visitors an unassailable 4-1 lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian Walker (20) provided some consolation for the Golf Club side in frame six with a 46-36 victory over John Teasdale (20) for a 4-2 scoreline.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the final frame of the match Darren Lawson (22) closed out the contest for Station Road with a solid 52-38 win over Mark Cowan (18), capping off a stellar team performance to finish the match at 5-2.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Workington&#8217;s United Club A continued their strong run in the tournament with a narrow 4-3 victory over Maryport Social, showcasing resilience and composure under pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben Scott (38) capitalized on his handicap advantage in frame one, defeating Dave Chapman (24) 62-16 to give Maryport an early 1-0 lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In frame two Andrew Sharp (32) maintained Maryport\u2019s upper hand with an authoritative 82-28 win over Peter O\u2019Hagan (6) for a 2-0 match scoreline.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frame three saw the first doubles frame with Peter O\u2019Hagan and Mark Suitor (19) rallying for United A, earning a close 61-51 victory over Gary Miller and Greg Todd (42) to pull one back at 2-1.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>United A Captain Andrew Mitchelhill and doubles partner Dave Chapman(18) levelled the match at 2-2 for the home side in frame four, with a stellar 78-60 winning performance against Ben Scott and Andrew Sharp (35).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back to the singles, Mark Suitor (32) delivered an under pressure black ball win to edge out Andrew Sharp (31) 57-52 in frame five to give United A their first lead of the match at 3-2.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it was Gary Miller (35) who kept Maryport Social alive in frame six by defeating Tony Hindmoor (50) 72-37 in a controlled display for 3-3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the seventh frame decider Andrew Mitchelhill (12) delivered a captain\u2019s performance, closing out the match with a dominant 76-44 win over Greg Todd (48), securing the 4-3 victory for United Club A.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the final Cup fixture of the week Workington Conservative Club raced to a 4-0 lead but were held off by a spirited Vets Club A side who dragged the score back to 4-3.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first Brian Kendall (50) was in top form delivering a 75-8 victory to give Workington Cons the early advantage at 1-0.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Julian Plaza (21) soon doubled the home side\u2019s lead with a precise 69-29 win over Mark Tunstall (25) in frame two as Cons moved 2-0 ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vets A pairing of Kevin Basnett and Mark Tatton (13) fought hard in the first doubles frame but were eventually overwhelmed by Alan Moore and Brian Kendall (32) 88-20 as Cons moved into a 3-0 lead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frame four saw Dave Holland and Ryan Barker (26) put the Cons\u2019 into an unbeatable 4-0 lead with a battling 61-54 victory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next Mark Tatton (26) delivered a superb performance to edge out Alan Moore (13) 62-48, finally getting a frame on the board for Vets A as the match score was drawn back to 4-1.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paul Smith (38) ensured the Vets A momentum was maintained with a gritty 61-54 win over Dave Holland (21) in frame six to pull the score back further for 4-2.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the final frame of the match Cons&#8217; Ryan Barker (31) played with determination however he was still unable to overcome Vets A&#8217;s Kevin Basnett (scratch) as the away team captain pulled a further frame back with a 79-65 victory to end the match just one adrift at 4-3.</p>\n",

Picture: Barney Clegg</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The try was set-up by some excellent play from the home backs ending with centre Kai Gilhespy taking the ball close before handing it over to Grant Bethwaite who joined the line from full-back and squeezed in at the corner flag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third try had one of the best finishes seen at Bower Park for several seasons. It was that man Bethwaite who had the crowd on their feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back row Owen Blackburn produced the hard yards to deliver the ball into the 22 but the attack looked to have run out of space before Bethwaite still metres short of the line started his dive into the corner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a thing of beauty as Bethwaite\u2019s body was out of play but crucially in the air as he flew past the corner flag to touch down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Aspatria holding a 15-0 advantage play began to even out and with ball in hand Upper Eden looked increasingly threatening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The home defence was forced into some last ditch defence before half-time to keep the visitors at bay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upper Eden retained this momentum at the start of the second half. Play transferred to the Aspatria half and under pressure, the home side started to give up penalties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With six minutes played Upper Eden looked certain to put points on the board. A quickly taken tap penalty caught Aspatria unawares and it should have been a walk-in score but the ball was dropped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upper Eden were lifted by their early success and minutes later another quickly taken penalty delivered a try from Matthew Brass. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now at 15-5 there was every sign that this game was far from done. Unfortunately, Upper Eden could not sustain the pressure and Aspatria gradually clawed back their earlier dominance.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Barney-Clegg-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-332981\" srcset=\"https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Barney-Clegg-2.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Barney-Clegg-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Barney-Clegg-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Barney-Clegg-2-219x146.jpg 219w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Owen Blackburn, Man of the Match. Picture: Barney Clegg</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>At number eight Chris Graham\u2019s willingness to carry the ball and take on the opposition was a factor in sapping Upper Eden\u2019s resolve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A charge from Graham played a major part in earning Aspatria a try bonus point. Graham did not score but he made the ground and provided the pass to hooker Adam Cavanagh whose full speed charge proved unstoppable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty minutes remained in the game but at 22-5 Aspatria had this one in the bag. Upper Eden had their moments but a combination of self-inflicted errors and a well-organised home defence diffused all scoring ambitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aspatria entered the final ten minutes fully in charge and the fifth try came from a penalty that was scrummed down ten metres out and the ball moved left to hand Gilhespy a well-deserved score.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the unluckiest player on the field was Lewis Gascoyne operating on the right flank. With a handful of minutes remaining a pacey run by Gascoyne ended with him touching down on the line but surrounded by defenders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the referee was unsighted and correctly could not award the score. Gascoyne\u2019s loss was centre Ben Toothill\u2019s gain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Aspatria recovered the ball it was immediately slung wide across the pitch where Toothill had an easy run to end the day\u2019s scoring.</p>\n",

This significant step forward ensures a more sustainable and cost-efficient future for the centre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, the trust partnered with Brampton 2 Zero, a Community Interest Company dedicated to sustainable energy solutions and biodiversity improvement, on a solar co-operative that planned to install panels across multiple sites in Brampton, with energy being sold to the respective sites at below-market rates. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the funding opportunity offered by the VCSE Energy Efficiency Scheme was too valuable to pass up, the trust said and meant the community centre will now generate and use its own power at no additional cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phil Furneaux, founding director of Brampton 2 Zero, said: &#8220;While we are saddened that Brampton and Beyond Community Trust is no longer part of our solar co-operative, we are thrilled to see them embrace sustainable energy solutions. Their progress contributes to our shared vision of promoting environmental responsibility across the community.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James Porter, chairman of Brampton and Beyond Community Trust, added: &#8220;This project is a major milestone for the community centre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;By lowering our energy costs, we can dedicate more resources to the programmes and services that enrich the lives of Brampton residents. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are grateful for the support of Brampton 2 Zero and the opportunities provided by the VCSE Energy Efficiency Scheme.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The VCSE Energy Efficiency Scheme, funded by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, is a \u00a325.5 million initiative designed to help organisations in England enhance energy efficiency. It offers energy assessments and capital grants to implement measures that reduce energy costs, support service delivery, and improve financial resilience.</p>\n",

I want to climb the ladder, become a change management leader and put things in place that are more appropriate for patients, like trauma-informed care.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;During the challenging times, education was my lifeline. College was where I got to focus on something else. I loved getting away from the house, being surrounded by like-minded people and the sense of achievement in getting good grades.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI kept getting uprooted and had to move college three times. It showed how important education was to me because I never gave up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jade&#8217;s been recognised for her achievements in the face of adversity. She was awarded an Edge Hill Excellence Scholarship and was shortlisted for Most Inspirational Student of the Year at the coveted Student Nursing Times Awards 2024.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She has taken every opportunity while studying at Edge Hill, including spending a month in Tanzania. She will soon build on this experience with a working trip to Bali.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jade added: &#8220;I want care leavers to recognise they have as much right to be at university as somebody with a conventional upbringing. People didn\u2019t think I\u2019d make it to uni, but believe in yourself and do what you want to do. Feel the fear and do it anyway! If you&#8217;re willing to give it your all, uni life is so rewarding.&#8221;\u00a0.\u00a0</p>\n",

Although we do have a lift to the auditorium there is limited space upstairs for accommodating customers in wheelchairs, and the sound desk is not wheelchair accessible. The Egremont Room provides completely level access for all.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are also very keen to encourage more local sound engineers to join our team of volunteers at the centre, with there being so many events on our calendar it\u2019s a lot to cover.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volunteer sound engineer Kev Farish will be sharing his skills and experience of sound engineering with a series of training sessions early in 2025, alongside Peter Tandy, who has been a volunteer sound engineer with the Kirkgate team for the past 18 months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie added: \u201cWithout the award from the Lakes to the Sea panel we wouldn\u2019t have been able to purchase such good quality equipment for the space, which is increasingly used for live music, presentations and panel events, and this also gives us the opportunity to invite budding new sound engineers to come and learn the art of live production in a more comfortable and accessible space.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new equipment will also be available for use by the many rural venues hosting Kirkgate Arts Out West shows across the region.</p>\n",

But how many of these charities will be distributing the largesse of the public in Cumbria?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An email that hit the cat\u2019s inbox this week was for Great Ormond Street Hospital, and this begs some questions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, a general one \u2013 why does a hospital need to appeal for extra funds over and above what they receive from the NHS/taxation? Do they use the donations from the public for things over and above the health services they provide?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A glance at their website suggests that they use the donations for activities that support the treatment and recovery of children and their families, but also to carry out \u201cground-breaking research into children\u2019s health\u201d.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the former may be an acceptable reason for charity, is research not the province of both the wider NHS and part of the university estate who spend 14% of the total money that feeds higher education? In 2020/21, research monies totalled \u00a315bn!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second question is far more parochial. Should the good people of Cumbria be supporting a hospital where the majority of cases come from their south east/London catchment area? In the north we have Alder Hey Children\u2019s Hospital in Liverpool and Royal Manchester Children\u2019s Hospital, both more likely as destinations for any child needing specialist paediatric care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what about those children being treated in the Cumberland Infirmary, the Westmorland General Hospital, Furness General Hospital or West Cumberland Hospital?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could local donations be directed to these to make the child\u2019s treatment that little bit better?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond health, what about other \u2018national\u2019 charities seeking our cash this time of year? Crisis at Christmas has TV adverts asking for donations but their Christmas centres are all in London although they do operate in other cities but not, directly, in Cumbria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, this cat\u2019s mouse hunting reward money will be going to the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Carlisle Key \u2013 supporting 16 \u2013 25 year olds homeless or at risk of homelessness in the Carlisle area.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>North Cumbria Hospitals NHS Charity \u2013 Working with Cumbria Community Foundation, seeks to improve the experience of both patients and their families.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bay Hospitals Charity \u2013 doing the same at Furness general Hospital in Barrow-in Furness, and Westmorland General Hospital in Kendal.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Furness Homeless Support group (Homeless Link) who offer a day centre for homeless people offering them practical support \u2013 showers and laundry, phone and computer access \u2013 as well as lunch and support to find accommodation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Time To Change (TTC) West Cumbria who offer support for the homeless including hostel accommodation and support packs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Salvation Army \u2013 Barrow, Carlisle, Kendal, Whitehaven and Workington \u2013 who work with any and all vulnerable members of our communities including providing gifts for Children \u2013 drop off new toys at any of their centres or shops.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jigsaw, Cumbria\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospice.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, YOU will know those charities key to helping in your area, your town or village. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever you can afford to give, no matter how small, will make a difference at this giving time of year.</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"about-cumbria-cat\">About Cumbria Cat</h2>\n\n\n<p>Born in Cumberland and, now, back living in Cumberland, having spent most of the past 50 years in some place called Cumbria, this cat has used up all nine lives as well as a few others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always happy to curl up on a friendly lap, the preference is for a local lap and not a lap that wants to descend on the county to change it into something it isn\u2019t. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After all, you might think Cumbria/Cumberland/Westmorland is a land forged by nature \u2013 the glaciers, the rivers, breaking down the volcanic rocks or the sedimentary layers \u2013 but, in reality, the Cumbria we know today was forged by generations of local people, farmers, miners, quarriers, and foresters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This cat is a local moggy, not a Burmese, Ocicat or Persian, and although I have been around the block a few times, whenever I jump, I end up on my feet back in my home county. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am passionate about the area, its people, past, present and future, and those who come to admire what we hold dear, be it lakes and mountains, wild sea shores, vibrant communities or the history as rich and diverse as anywhere in the world.</p>\n",

The work is expected to last five days, weather permitting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although work is carried out during these hours, the road will remain closed for the full duration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project will include essential road network repairs, drainage replacement, and refreshed road markings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vehicle access for residents and businesses will be maintained whenever possible, and specific access needs can be discussed with on-site staff. Full access will be available for emergency service vehicles, pedestrians, and dismounted cyclists throughout the works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Waste and recycling collections will proceed as normal, while updates about temporary bus stop relocations will be posted at affected stops. Passengers with bus route questions are encouraged to contact Stagecoach directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cumberland Council said it recognised the A5086 was a key route and was working closely with local stakeholders, including parish councils and local members, to minimise disruption as much as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The council asked for the community\u2019s patience and co-operation and said it had a zero-tolerance policy regarding threatening or abusive behaviour.</p>\n",
