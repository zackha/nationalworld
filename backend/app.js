The two competitions will have the same points limit and regulations, but they will run as separate entities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is possible for riders to sign both for a club in the NDL and also a club in the National Trophy – maximising their track time and almost doubling their meetings at this level compared with 2024.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWorkington were among the teams listed for the National Trophy at the end of November, but it has now been revealed that they will not compete. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELeicester will join Birmingham, Kent Eagles, King’s Lynn and Plymouth in a league which provides four home and four away fixtures for riders, many of whom also have team places in the NDL.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELeicester’s inclusion in the NDT does not change any of the one-to-sevens already announced by other teams in the competition, and they have selected from riders available at the time of their entry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBritish Speedway chairman Rob Godfrey said: “With the timing of Workington making their decision, it was too late to move one of the (six) teams in the NDL across to the NDT, because they’d all already started or completed building their teams by then.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E“However, Leicester put up their hands straightaway and said they were willing to run two teams, and we’re grateful to them for solving what would have been an imbalance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E“It still gives more riders more track time, which is exactly what we’re looking to achieve – it fits what they want to do, and it fits what everyone wants to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E“It puts the NDT back to where we were originally, with five teams competing, and geographically it probably fits as well, so this is a positive outcome for all concerned.”\u003C/p\u003E\n',

The increased frequency in events being held within the marquee has now exceeded what was originally anticipated and has amplified the negative impacts, the report said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEvents held at Dalston Hall Hotel between March 9 and October 30 this year received 49 separate objections from Dalston Hall Holiday Park, the report added.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt said: &#8220;It should be noted that no complaints were received prior to the erection of the marquee when events were being held solely within the main hotel building.&#8221; \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn August, an investigation took place and concluded that noise disturbance continued to occur. Recorded music noise level was perceived as being over seven times louder than it should be. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe council&#8217;s environmental health department collected data on September 14 and 15, which resulted in a noise abatement notice being served on the hall on October 3. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDalston Hall Venue Ltd has appealed the notice and environmental health officers will continue to visit the site until they are satisfied that the noise abatement\u003Cbr\u003Enotice has been complied with.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESupporting evidence will be submitted sometime towards the end of January. Dalston Hall Hotel will then decide whether to continue with their appeal, and if they do it would be likely that the appeal would be heard sometime in April 2025, planning officers said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEnvironmental health said: &#8220;There continues to be insufficient control of guests leaving the premises after events. As a result, noise nuisance from guests shouting and singing is being caused to neighbouring premises.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;The frequency of events held at the Hotel has significantly increased during 2024 and is predicted to continue to increase into 2025.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;Holding functions within the marquee will continue to result in complaints being received by this department.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;In my opinion, the sound insulation properties of the marquee structure are not sufficient to adequately contain the levels of noise required by patrons wishing\u003Cbr\u003Eto enjoy live bands and loud recorded music, without causing nuisance to neighbouring premises.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;The maximum level of music which will not cause nuisance is unlikely to be sufficient for guests and there will be a constant pressure to increase levels during events by live bands and DJs.&#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe manager of Dalston Hall Hotel said its own assessments have discovered the source of the noise. Findings suggested that it was not through the opening and closing of doors, but through the existing roofing cover on the marquee.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECumbria police said there was no link between crime and use the marquee. However, it added, that its Neighbourhood Policing Team carried out a survey at Dalston Holiday Park and residents told them about numerous instances of anti-social and nuisance (particularly excessive noise) activity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe report added: &#8220;Cumbria police confirmed their stance in that, from a policing perspective, it appears the continued presence of the marquee is having a detrimental effect on the quality of life of residents nearby, for which there is anecdotal evidence.&#8221; \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe report to councillors said that while the marquee would continue to support an existing established rural building, its benefits did not outweigh the impact on its neighbours. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Gilchrist Collection submitted confidential financial information to the council, but the report to the committee said: &#8220;While this information illustrates that the retention of the marquee would no doubt be beneficial in terms of capacity flexibility for the business, it can be argued not essential as the premises operated successfully before the erection of the marquee.&#8221; \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe report concluded: &#8220;The current application lacks any mitigative measures or proposals to combat the objections received.&#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n',

It said: &#8220;This would equate to the removal of the line of spaces along the western boundary.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;This reduction equates to a 28% reduction in the additional 100 spaces proposed and 15.56% from the total number of proposed spaces. Meaning an overall reduction of 100% of the public or staff spaces.&#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the November meeting, councillors were concerned about air pollution, nearby residents and wondered about public transport options, which led to the deferment of the decision. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen they meet again on January 8, a planning officers report said since the publication of the original committee report, the National Planning Policy Framework \u003Cbr\u003Ehad been updated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt now says that to ensure faster delivery of other public service infrastructure, local planning authorities should work proactively and positively with promoters, delivery partners and statutory bodies to plan for required facilities and resolve key planning issues before applications are submitted. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt said significant weight should be placed on the importance of new, expanded or upgraded public service infrastructure when considering proposals for\u003Cbr\u003Edevelopment. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe report said: &#8220;The proposal to create a new car park to serve the hospital should, therefore, be given significant weight in the determination of the application.&#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n',

It has been mentioned on Cumbria Crack&#8230;\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, while they may want you to think that this is about having a more sustainable model for waste services and recycling, let us be very clear that this is, first and foremost, about saving money.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is made quite clear in the council executive minutes of their meeting on November 26, when it says: “The Sustainable, Resilient, and Connected Places Portfolio Holder reported that the recommended operating and delivery model was expected to deliver a substantial reduction against the current revenue costs, generate income revenue, and sought to address the future anticipated transformation savings.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat it doesn’t spell out, certainly in the bits of this that are in the public domain, is exactly how those savings are to be achieved. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIs this payback time for Allerdale-based bin collectors who defied them last summer? While the reason for holding back key information is mired in gobbledygook, this cat will bet it is because Allerdale bin emptying is still managed by an arm’s length company and this is a useful excuse for not mentioning any of the financial matters.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe rest – changes from boxes to bins in Carlisle (that will go down well in those areas with terraced houses) charging £40 for an additional garden waste bin or reducing black bin collections from weekly to fortnightly, will depend entirely on the make up of each household as one size does not fit all.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne area they appear to have overlooked, is kitchen waste. Just think of all those brussels sprout or potato trimmings, or, heaven forbid, the left over turkey.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Cumberland Council, everyone, should be making their own compost (again, think terraced housing) and, if not, this waste has to go into the black, general, waste bin where it will start to smell pretty quickly especially in summer while householders wait for their fortnightly bin collections.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt will also attract vermin and if you think I am responsible for sorting out the rats in the neighbourhood, you are mistaken &#8211; I am far too good looking for that!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, it appears the decision to go ahead has already been taken.

Maximising contributions to these products can help investors manage their tax liabilities more effectively.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhilst advice to complete an annual transfer from your GIA to your ISA or pension continues to stand true, it could be that the transferable amount is now limited or completed over a longer period of time. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnnual market performance has seen a dip over the last couple of years, but as we continue to a recovery, gains on holdings are increasing. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEffectively, this time last year it is likely that your fund value was lower, and the CGT exemption was higher, whereas this year the value is higher, and the exemption is lower.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reduced CGT exemption may also influence your investment decisions. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might become more cautious about realising gains, opting instead to hold onto investments for longer periods, or as a legacy investment to leave to your loved ones in the event of your death. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt may, of course, be possible that some of your funds have lost value, these holdings can be sold and used to offset gains from other funds. This can be helpful and will offer slightly increased flexibility when calculating the overall gains.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch2 class="wp-block-heading"\u003EIs it worth paying an increase CGT liability?\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere will be times when it makes sense to realise a gain and pay the tax, but it doesn’t have to be negative, as any gain is a sign the portfolio has performed well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERealising a gain will allow you to consider the possibility of a new environment, the funds may remain in a GIA, but as mentioned, other options include ISAs, pensions and onshore or offshore bonds where suitable. It may be worth considering a CGT budget, where some of the fund is sold rather than all of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, an individual has held capital in a GIA since the early 2000s, with an accrued value of £150,000. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis represents the majority of their investment portfolio, and having never moved any of this money to a tax-free environment, their gains are now in the region of £60,000. Inclusive of the £3,000 CGT exemption allowance, the CGT tax bill (taxed at the higher 24% rate) will be £13,680.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a case like this, good financial planning will always be to avoid letting the ‘tax tail wag the dog’ and consider moving the capital to a new environment in order to mitigate the risk of being overweight in a taxable environment. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESelling the investment can allow for more effective management and increase the opportunity to meet long term goals and objectives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGiven the complexities introduced by the above changes, seeking professional financial advice is more important than ever.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"\u003EPlease get in touch to speak to speak to a member of our financial planning team.

Mason Partners will manage the site on a day-to-day basis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe council said it was currently exploring options to improve the hall&#8217;s experience and offer, including a potential communal seating area to help attract more people to eat and shop there. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Market Hall is Grade II listed and an application for listed building consent has been submitted to gain in-principal approval for works that would affect the historic fabric.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESome concept designs for a communal seating area were included in the application to provide some context, the council said, but the designs would need to be developed further.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECouncillor Barbara Cannon, executive member for financial planning and assets, said: “These recent developments at the Market Hall are really positive news for Carlisle and the wider Cumberland area.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;We look forward to working with Bearmont, the new managing agents and existing traders and stallholders to develop the site and help it reach its full potential.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E“The Market Hall presents a huge opportunity to create an exciting destination for residents and visitors that would contribute to the vitality and sustainability of Carlisle city centre. It’s been a much-loved part of the city’s retail offer for generations and we’re excited to see what the future holds.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERob Lloyd, CEO of Bearmont Group, said: “The Market Hall represents the heart of Carlisle’s retail experience, and we see a tremendous opportunity to bring new energy to this historic site. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;This is part of our strategic approach &#8211; identifying shopping centres that have lost their way and giving them a new lease on life. We’ll be working closely with Cumberland Council to breathe new life into the indoor market, with an emphasis on introducing more local artisan businesses and an expanded food offering. We’ve already received interest from prospective tenants for the former Wilko site, and we hope to announce further developments shortly.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMr Lloyd said Bearmont’s focus was on supporting local retail and driving foot traffic by blending traditional retail with fresh, modern offerings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHe added: “Markets today need to inspire people to visit; we’re looking at introducing more artisan vendors, like butchers, fishmongers, and bakers, to restore that personal, vibrant atmosphere where shoppers can enjoy unique, quality goods and genuine interactions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;We are keen to welcome smaller local businesses that require flexible, cost-effective space. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;As a private company, we can make quick decisions &#8211; often within a day or two &#8211; allowing us to respond rapidly to the needs of our tenants, especially independent retailers.”\u003C/p\u003E\n',

But after deliberating for just over 12 hours, a jury of seven men and five women did find Mounsey guilty of two alternative, lesser charges — those of wounding Mr Bennett and the child with intent to cause grievous bodily harm — on majority verdicts of 10 to two, and 11 to one, respectively.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring evidence, jurors heard how Mounsey stabbed 56-year-old Mr Bennett as he lay sleeping on a living room sofa inside the address at Whernside on June 10.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMr Bennett felt a jab and heard what he described as a crunch from his neck before seeing Mounsey with the knife and realising what had happened, Carlisle Crown Court heard.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs he tried to flee the house, bleeding, and reached the garden steps, Mounsey grabbed and jumped on to him before attempting to stab him again. “I was just trying to get out; just trying to run for my life,” Mr Bennett told a jury.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the immediate aftermath, Mr Bennett had told neighbours of her attack on him: “Jackie has stabbed us”.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring the incident, Mounsey also stabbed a child to both sides of the neck. A pathologist viewed a CT scan which showed the wounds were very close to penetrating the internal jugular vein. The expert estimated the youngster may have been potentially millimetres from losing their life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth Mr Bennett and the child were treated in hospital before later being discharged. Mounsey also suffered injuries which the pathologist suggested could be tentative or hesitant.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA neighbour who saw Mounsey and the child bleeding from neck wounds  spoke of something like a scene from a horror movie.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E“This is a difficult and tragic case,” prosecutor Iain Simkin KC had told jurors as he opened the case against Mounsey.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe prosecutor suggested Mounsey had gone on to stab herself after attacking Mr Bennett and the child, adding: “What is without doubt members of the jury, is that all three of them were very lucky to survive.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJurors watched video footage captured by two detectives at a bail address after she had been interviewed and gave mostly no comment answers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring long exchanges, she hinted at wanting to tell the officers something.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E“What I’ve got to say is going to get me into trouble,” she initially said. “I want to tell you but I don’t want jail.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E“I just want to confess now,” she continued. “I did it.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGiving evidence, Mounsey said she remembered nothing from June 10, nor making the subsequent, telling comments to police. She spoke of being devastated by the earlier death of her mother, which had brought other past trauma firmly into focus.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMounsey showed no emotion as the four verdicts were returned.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJudge Nicholas Barker said he would not pass sentence immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHe instead adjourned the case until February 7, ordering the preparation of a probation service report following an assessment of Mounsey; and impact statements on behalf of Mr Bennett and the child.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E“You have heard the jury’s verdicts on you in respect of these two very serious charges of wounding with intent,” said Judge Barker to Mounsey.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E“I have called for reports and statements to be obtained to assist me with the sentence. I simply say this, which is something you will be aware of: the only sentence the court can give you, certainly at this stage, is a sentence of immediate custody. That will be of some duration. Beyond that I will say nothing further.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMounsey, previously of Whernside, remains remanded in custody.\u003C/p\u003E\n',

The dysfunctional family, played by talented actors like Rebecca Gayheart, Chris Kattan, Fran Drescher, and James Caan, are dispatched by Santa in various creative and Christmas-themed ways.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s a fantastic introduction that prepares the audience for what’s ahead.

Directed by Magnus Marten, There&#8217;s Something In The Barn is a Christmas comedy horror that delivers a fantastic blend of laughs and gore.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStarring Martin Starr, Amrita Acharia, and introducing the talented Townes Bunner in his screen acting debut, this film takes viewers on a wild and mischievous ride.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom the moment I caught the trailer for There&#8217;s Something In The Barn a few months ago, I knew it would be a great fun watch. Not only does it feature the talented Martin Starr in a starring role, but he also serves as a producer, adding his comedic touch to the film.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStarr has consistently impressed with his performances in some funny films over the years, and it&#8217;s always a pleasure to see him on screen. One of the highlights of the film is the design of the barn elves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey resemble dirty little Santas, adding a visually appealing element to the story. Their mischievous nature is a constant source of entertainment, leading to gruesome consequences for the unsuspecting family.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe film is packed with proper Christmas tunes like &#8220;Sleigh Ride,&#8221; &#8220;Jingle Bell Rock,&#8221; and &#8220;Holly Jolly Christmas,&#8221; which enhance the festive atmosphere and immerse viewers in the holiday spirit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe family dynamics in There&#8217;s Something In The Barn are quite disjointed, and as the mischievous elf unleashes havoc, the fractures within the family become more pronounced. It starts off slowly, introducing us to the family and the barn elf, as Lucas, the son, tries to follow the three important Barn Elf Rules.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the family dismisses the existence of barn elves, leading to a Night of the Living Dead-style chaos when an army of elves descends upon them. The film delivers great gory fun, with great splatter and practical effects used for the elves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe mischievousness of the elves brings to mind the classic Gremlins (1984), with their rule-breaking antics and their indulgence in booze and partying amidst the carnage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMy only gripe is it could have been slightly shorter, losing about ten minutes to maintain a tighter pace, it remains a solid entry into the pantheon of Christmas horror films.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe film is so much fun that I would gladly watch it again, as it successfully combines humor and gore, culminating in a touch of Christmas sentiment at the end. It’s a funny and blood splattered Christmas comedy horror that delivers on its promise of laughs and thrills.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Martin Starr&#8217;s cracking performance, memorable practical effects, and a mischievous army of barn elves, this film is a must-watch for fans of the genre.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDespite a slight pacing issue, the film&#8217;s ability to balance humour and horror makes it a delightful addition to the Christmas horror canon. Get ready for a wild and festive ride with There&#8217;s Something In The Barn!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERating: 15\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch2 class="wp-block-heading"\u003EIT’S A WONDERFUL KNIFE (2023)\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cfigure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"\u003E\u003Cdiv class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class="jeg_video_container jeg_video_content"\u003E\u003Ciframe title="IT&#039;S A WONDERFUL KNIFE Official Trailer (2023)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VsKLKriMch4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27619382/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk"\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is another that you can find on Amazon Prime via Shudder.

With talents like Justin Long, who never fails to deliver, the film delivers a belter performance from him as he embraces the role with gusto, complete with some crazy dental work that makes his teeth appear massive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPenned by the same writers as the cracking slasher film with a twist, Freaky, It showcases the same creativity and mastery of the genre.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe film takes inspiration from Scream, slightly adopting the look and actions of the killer, while also featuring some fantastic practical gore effects and bloody kills that us horror fans will relish.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile It may not be perfect, it is undeniably a great, fun watch. As a fan of Christmas horror films, I couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better way to kick off the festive season.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe film keeps you engaged throughout and delivers some unexpected twists that add to the film and I wasn’t expecting.The twist within the twist in it is a stroke of brilliance, leaving me pleasantly surprised as I didn’t see it coming.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me, this film was an excellent start to my festive fright films. It combined the joyous spirit of the holiday season with the bloody elements of a slasher film, creating a unique blend of genres.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s a festive slasher delight that offers a fresh twist on a beloved Christmas film.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith a cracking cast, fantastic practical effects, and unexpected twists, it delivers a cracking and enjoyable film.

He is also dedicating major fundraising efforts next year to support Hospice at Home, Eden Valley Hospice, and Pancreatic Cancer Action in memory of his father.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDebbie McKenna, CEO of Hospice at Home Carlisle and North Lakeland, said: “We are thrilled to welcome Ian as our new charity ambassador. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;His enthusiasm, extensive network, and deep understanding of the importance of our services will be invaluable as we strive to reach more people and secure vital funding. Ian’s personal connection to Hospice at Home adds a heartfelt layer to his advocacy, and we are excited about the impact he will have.”\u003C/p\u003E\n',

Reds had blocked two attempts in quick succession but couldn’t prevent a firm low strike from finding the bottom left-hand corner of Mitchell’s net.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReds won their first corner soon after the restart but Aiden Dowling dealt with the cross unchallenged. But, from their next flag kick, Jordan Little saw his goal-bound header tipped over the bar by the City keeper.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen the hosts got forward in their next attack, Charlie Bailey squandered a good opportunity when it looked easier to score.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReds restored parity after seventy-two minutes with a well worked goal. The ball was switched from left to right with Galloway making ground before delivering a decent cross into the area and top scorer Rigg finished confidently in front of the large travelling away support.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen Mitchell was next called upon, he made a fine save to deny Mansell.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut Workington seemed to have the momentum and were encouraged to push on for the winner by the hordes backing the West Cumbrians.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd when Kai Nugent delivered a pin-point cross from the left, it should have been the match-winning moment. It fell to Dav Symington, making a welcome return to the team after a 10-game absence, but the substitute couldn’t keep his effort under the bar, and the chance was gone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFell, was pleased with the team’s commitment. He said: “It was another goal for Riggy, a good point on the road and has given us a good platform to go into the Boxing Day game with confidence.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E“Our support today was incredible and they got us back in the game.

They were forced to dig deep into squad resources to field a team for this tough visit to North East High Flyers, Morpeth.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe forwards were in reasonable shape bolstered by James Dowling coming in for his first game of the season and Phil Dixon emerging from retirement to help out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe back division suffered the most disruption with veteran playmaker Steven Stoddart answering the call alongside another ‘retiree’ in the shape of centre Heinie Jonker. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShort of a right winger, Lewis Barwise normally a backrow volunteered for the role. On the bench, there were two new faces in Jonny Miller and Connor Sinkinson.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so Aspatria began the game with little expectation but they did have a game plan and that was to keep the ball tight in the forwards when possession came their way. For near enough all the game they did this to perfection.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the first half Aspatria enjoyed a strong wind at their backs as they attacked the club house end. They used the conditions wisely to pen Morpeth back and took a near immediate lead when Barwise neatly squeezed in at the corner for 0-5. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe momentum for the try came from a line breaking run from second row Jude Wilkinson who in his first season with Aspatria continues to impress.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\u003Cdiv class="wp-block-image"\u003E\n\u003Cfigure class="aligncenter size-full"\u003E\u003Cimg loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Aspatria-rugby-3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-335354" srcset="https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Aspatria-rugby-3.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Aspatria-rugby-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Aspatria-rugby-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Aspatria-rugby-3-219x146.jpg 219w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /\u003E\u003Cfigcaption class="wp-element-caption"\u003EPicture: Barney Clegg\u003C/figcaption\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe pressure was too much for Morpeth who following the early score conceded a succession of penalties and with only 12 minutes elapsed Stoddart had used two of these to provide Aspatria with a 0:11 advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMorpeth, perhaps recognising that they were not going to get any change out of the visiting pack began to play a more expansive game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor them this was the correct tactic and it worked. By the 21st minutes two fluent backs moves delivered a couple of converted tries to give the home side a 14-11 lead. It very much looked like normal service resumed but Aspatria had other ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMorpeth simply could not handle a rampant Aspatria pack. On 23 minutes Wilkinson benefitted from some excellent work by No8 Chris Graham to outpace a covering defence and go over. Minutes later, Wilkinson’s second row partner, Riley Thwaites added a 3rd try.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt this stage Aspatria were in full control of the game and in the 10 minutes prior to half time added two more tries, both coming after forceful work by the pack but scored by Stoddard who converted each of them to establish a 23 point gap at 14-37.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the final play of the half Morpeth struck back and yet again it was a backs effort that ran wide and around the Aspatria defence.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe half finished with a 21-37 score line in favour of Aspatria. Still a handsome margin but Morpeth had two reasons to feel this game was far from over. Firstly, they now had the benefit of the conditions and secondly they knew that spreading the ball wide was a key to further scores.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second half was only minutes old when Morpeth ran in a 4th try and at 28-37 the home side were right back in contention but as the half progressed their frustration began to grow as Aspatria’s ball retention tactics looked to be capable of winning the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was at times ugly stuff as Aspatria ground their way upfield with close in, pick and go moves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\u003Cdiv class="wp-block-image"\u003E\n\u003Cfigure class="aligncenter size-full"\u003E\u003Cimg loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Aspatria-rugby-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-335353" srcset="https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Aspatria-rugby-2.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Aspatria-rugby-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Aspatria-rugby-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Aspatria-rugby-2-219x146.jpg 219w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /\u003E\u003Cfigcaption class="wp-element-caption"\u003EPicture: Barney Clegg\u003C/figcaption\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the game crept into the final quarter Aspatria looked more that capable of holding on for a win.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe visitors won a series of penalties in the home 22 as they took apart the Morpeth scrum. Morpeth were warned by the referee and one forward was yellow carded. On the third resetting of a five metre scrum No8 Graham came flying off the back to launch himself over the line for an unconverted score.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInto the final 10 minutes Aspatria held a 28-42 lead but understandably an element of fatigue crept into the Aspatria effort. The game turned dramatically in favour of Morpeth.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMorpeth were now able to clearly see that Aspatria were in difficulty trying to defend a wide pitch. The home backs proved merciless in exploiting this and long range tries began to flow. It takes some doing to score three tries with only a few minutes remaining on the clock, so credit must go to Morpeth for achieving this with the final one and the game winning score coming with the final play off the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA 13-try thriller ended in Morpeth’s favour and they continue the season with an outside chance of promotion. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen the dust settles Aspatria will recognise that the bonus points earned may prove vital if the relegation battle gets any tighter. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor now, and based on this performance they can look forward with optimism for 2025 when a full complement of players will be back in action.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis report cannot end without praising all the players who travelled to Morpeth, particularly Dixon and Jonker who came out of retirement and played their parts magnificently. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChris Graham took the man of the match honour but in truth there would have been little argument if any of the pack had been named. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe performance of Steven Stoddart operating at No10 also demands recognition. With the wind blowing a gale the experience of Stoddart was invaluable.\u003C/p\u003E\n',

Kieran Mewse&#8217;s conversion was on target but was buffeted sideways by the wind just as it reached the sticks, leaving the score at 5-0. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe game remained a tight battle, but Keswick were stronger in the scrum, their pack dominated, and quick distribution by Matty Roper, clever kicking from Glen Weightman, and the pace of Chris Potter in particular gave Keswick the upper hand. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\u003Cdiv class="wp-block-image"\u003E\n\u003Cfigure class="aligncenter size-full"\u003E\u003Cimg loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="560" src="https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Kirkby-Lonsdale-ready-for-the-line-out-Ben-Challis.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-335335" srcset="https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Kirkby-Lonsdale-ready-for-the-line-out-Ben-Challis.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Kirkby-Lonsdale-ready-for-the-line-out-Ben-Challis-300x164.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Kirkby-Lonsdale-ready-for-the-line-out-Ben-Challis-768x420.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Kirkby-Lonsdale-ready-for-the-line-out-Ben-Challis-260x142.jpg 260w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /\u003E\u003Cfigcaption class="wp-element-caption"\u003EKirkby Lonsdale ready for the line out (Ben Challis)\u003C/figcaption\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKeswick then again put sustained pressure on the Kirkby Lonsdale try line, using repeated scrums to drive forwards, with Man Of The Match Dan Alllaker putting in a tremendous shift. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth Lewis Bell and Karl Smyth came close to scoring before it was James Benson who crashed through under the sticks to secure Keswick&#8217;s second try which Mewse duly converted for a 12-0 lead at half time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second half opened with a prolonged hail storm, with the remaining supporters struggling to make out what was happening further away on the pitch in the fading light for much of the next 40 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith footings now treacherous, it was Allday who again used his speed to set up what was going to Keswick&#8217;s third try. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHe was tackled a metre short of the try line, and when the tackler then failed to release Allday, with any of Potter, Mewse and Roper well placed to pounce and score, referee Martin Maughan no option but to award Keswick a penalty try and seven more points.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe final try was another Allday sprint, chased by three closing  Kirby Lonsdale defenders, with Allday opting to dive five metres out, somehow sliding forwards on the soaking wet and now icy pitch to come to a stop well over the visitors&#8217; try line, despite all three defenders holding onto him, to cement a very good win.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\u003Cdiv class="wp-block-image"\u003E\n\u003Cfigure class="aligncenter size-full"\u003E\u003Cimg loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="663" src="https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/James-Benson-crashes-in-to-touch-down-Ben-Challis.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-335333" srcset="https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/James-Benson-crashes-in-to-touch-down-Ben-Challis.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/James-Benson-crashes-in-to-touch-down-Ben-Challis-300x194.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/James-Benson-crashes-in-to-touch-down-Ben-Challis-768x497.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/James-Benson-crashes-in-to-touch-down-Ben-Challis-225x146.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /\u003E\u003Cfigcaption class="wp-element-caption"\u003EJames Benson crashes in to touch down (Ben Challis)\u003C/figcaption\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the clubs around Keswick in the league all losing (Carlisle 21-55 to Middlesbrough, Upper Eden 14-22 to Consett, Aspatria 42-47 to Morpeth and Guisborough 12-57 to West Hartlepool) Keswick now sit in seventh spot in the league, and have a game in hand over sixth placed Consett. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHead coach Garry Holmes said: &#8220;A lot of praise must go out to the players on both teams for battling hard in horrendous conditions. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;Playing into the wind in the first half, our defence held well, and Kirkby didn&#8217;t use the wind as we expected them too. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;When they did kick, Kieran Mewse was solid at the back and got a lot of joy running it back.

With National Minimum Wage and employer National Insurance Contributions increasing in April 2025, employers will need to be extra vigilant in these areas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf HMRC launches an investigation the range of records and documents the inspector might check is vast and will likely include your annual HMRC tax returns, any PAYE records, tax you have paid, self-assessment returns, full company records or tax calculation evidence.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"\u003EIf you would like tax advice and support for you and/or your business please call 01768222030 or email \u003Ca href="mailto:help@armstrongwatson.co.uk"\u003Ehelp@armstrongwatson.co.uk\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\n',

We are sure this team will be one to watch and once again it\u2019s great we have introduced British speedway into some more exciting new talent from the continent in Fraser Bowes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI think the key to next season will be our reserves. Last season we struggled in that department for most of the year which probably hindered us in the playoffs when you look at other teams, but securing Vinnie Foord and Jacob Hook will be huge for us. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Vinnie showed everyone last year he is pure box office and is prepared to put himself on the line to win, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. The sport needs these characters and a team needs these characters to be successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAt the end of last season, I said we only wanted to sign a rider that wanted to ride for Workington \u2013 and every single rider we have signed has already shown their commitment and enthusiasm to the club which is fantastic.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said last season was a great achievement for the team, as Comets reached the play-offs, but 2025 would need to see the side go one &#8211; or two &#8211; steps further. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: &#8220;I think the team we have secured for next season is a formidable one. Of course, we haven\u2019t turned a wheel for next season yet, but everything is looking really positive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have signed the team we want, the uptake for season tickets has been outstanding and we are also retaining and gaining new sponsorship partners for next season already.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI think our fans should be very excited for next season, it\u2019s a team with bit of edge to it again. We just need our fans and Workington as an area to come out in force in 2025 to support our club, as I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to be another fantastic season.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were some hard decisions to be made in building this season&#8217;s team, he added, and losing captain Craig Cook was one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added:  \u201cWe had to make some tough decisions in our team-building process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe knew that we wanted two stronger reserves than we had last year for next season and unfortunately it came down to numbers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Craig did great for us last season, he seemed to be enjoying his speedway again which was brilliant to see and he was also a fantastic captain but it was a decision that had to be made and we didn\u2019t take it lightly. We all wish him well with Berwick next season.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Team boss James Denham added: \u201cWe are all really pleased with what the team we have built for 2025, and once again we really do think this will be a competitive team next season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTroy Batchelor had a fantastic year for us last season, he rejuvenated his passion for the sport and enjoyed his speedway again with us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He was also great with the riders and fans alike last year and really stepped up to the occasion in the big meetings such as Berwick and Redcar when we were chasing the playoffs and were down on numbers.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWith in that in mind, it was an obvious decision to make him the captain for next season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think he has some solid backup as well, Tate Zischke and Antti Vuolas will know what to expect of all the away tracks now and Jye Etheridge is already vastly experienced in the UK. Also Vinnie, along with Jacob, will probably be one of the strongest reserve duos in the league.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFraser Bowes will also come over to us with a vast amount of experience on the continent to make his British speedway debut, but like Tate and Antti last year there will need to be a few meetings where he gets up to speed in the UK.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n',

Squally showers, hail and thunder are also possible in some places. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The weather forecaster said there is a potential for delays to public transport and some disruption to the road network, which may have a greater than usual impact given the busier pre-Christmas weekend travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It added that dangerous coastal conditions can be expected too, with large waves an additional hazard.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What should I expect?</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are likely</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It\u2019s likely that some coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities will be affected by spray and/or large waves</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Probably some bus and train services affected, with some journeys taking longer</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some short term loss of power and other services is possible</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely</li>\n\n\n\n<li>There is a small chance of isolated, short term loss of power</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why should I care about weather warnings?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Weather warnings are issued to let people know what weather is in store for their area and what its impact could be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Met Office is the UK\u2019s official weather service and is responsible for issuing weather warnings to the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three main levels of weather warning:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Yellow \u2013 which asks people to be prepared for disruption</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amber \u2013 which asks people to change plans that could be impacted by the weather and take action to protect themselves and their property</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Red \u2013 which is issued for weather that poses a danger to life and asks people to immediately take direct action to keep themselves and others safe from impacts of the weather</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Yellow and amber warnings represent a range of impact levels and likelihoods. This means it is important to read each warning to know what level of impact to expect in your local area \u2013 and how likely those impacts are to occur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Met Office began issuing impact-based warnings in 2011 \u2013 which means that warnings are issued when the weather may have an impact on people\u2019s day to day lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous to this, warnings were issued to the public when certain weather thresholds or levels were reached.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Impact-based warnings take multiple factors into account \u2013 these include time of day, if it may impact traffic, time of year, if the weather is unusual, if there are any seasonal events taking place and if the area is well equipped to deal with the weather.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each warning level is designed to help people take steps to minimise the chances of disruption in their liv</p>\n',

followed by the vacant retail units on English Street, which gave a view of where the Gateway Building will be located, the Woolworths/ Burtons building (Hub Building) and the former Armed Forces Careers Centre, location of the Carlisle Business Exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once inside the buildings a series of CGI images were displayed with QR codes that brought the space to life through the use of augmented reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also on the tour were representatives from Cumberland Council, Borderlands Partnership, Day Architects and Identity Consult who are supporting the university with the planning and consultancy around the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prof Mennell said: \u201cWe are happy to have this opportunity to update the city\u2019s MP on progress made to date and the next steps of this major scheme. </p>\n\n\n<div id="jig1" class="justified-image-grid jig-50f86e54eb3eb3eede0c7a2ab898fb7a jig-preset-global jig-source-wp-gallery"><div class="jig-clearfix"></div><noscript

This means it is illegal to use them on the road or in public spaces, such as parks, street pavements, and shopping centres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last 12 months officers in Cumbria have seized 39 e-scooters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is only legal to use e-scooters on private land such as your garden, but you must have permission from the landowners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are trial areas in which you can rent an e-scooters &#8211; however there are none in Cumbria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspector Jack Stabler, from Cumbria police&#8217;s Road Policing Unit, said: \u201cIn Cumbria, it remains against the law to ride a privately owned e-scooter on public roads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhile we understand why people may want to buy them for Christmas its important you are aware of the laws and that you comply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf anyone is found to be riding an e-scooter on a public road or footpath the e-scooter could be seized, your present lost and you will be reported for offences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThese aren\u2019t toys and can cause serious injury to riders or other path or road users if ridden irresponsibly.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service said there were dangers associated with rechargeable batteries built into e-scooters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cheaper and non-branded e-scooters can pose a risk of fire. Even expensive versions can cause a fire if they are not charged appropriately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service\u2019s Lauren Woodward, area manager for prevention and protection, said:\u00a0\u201cWe would discourage anyone from buying an e-scooter due to the legalities of using it on public roads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHowever, if you do have one, they should be charged in a safe manner. Simple tips such as: Not charging it while you sleep; unplugging the charger once it\u2019s done; not covering the charger or scooter whilst it charging to let any excess heat escape; ensuring the e-scooter aren\u2019t blocking an escape route in the event of a fire and not overloading plug sockets will reduce the risk of fire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf you have a stolen or counterfeit e-scooter, we would strongly advise you not to use it as it may not have been through the appropriate safety tests that legitimate sellers need to pass in order to sell their wares.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe want everyone to have a safe Christmas without a fire so please be careful around rechargeable electronics.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cumbria\u2019s Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner David Allen, said:\u00a0\u201cE-scooters are still growing in popularity, but it is really important that we take the law into account when buying them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI would urge all parents and family members not to buy an e-scooter for their children \u2013 we don\u2019t want to see anyone have their present seized by police, or worse, hurt in an accident on our roads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI would also encourage anyone who already owns an e-scooter to follow the safety tips provided by Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service \u2013 no one wants a fire in their home due to leaving a charger on for an inappropriate amount of time or due to faulty goods.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPlease be sensible, think through your gifts and stay safe.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">E-bikes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can ride an electric bike if you are aged 14 or over, as long as it meets certain requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These requirements are that the&nbsp;E-Bike must be classed as an&nbsp;electrically assisted pedal cycle (EAPC).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An EAPC must:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Have pedals that can be used to propel it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Show either the power output or the manufacturer of the motor.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Show either the battery\u2019s voltage or the maximum speed of the bike.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have an electric motor with a maximum power output of 250 watts.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Not have a motor able to propel the bike when it\u2019s travelling at more than 15.5mph.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If an electric bike falls within the EAPC definition, legally it is treated like a regular, non-assisted pedal cycle. You don\u2019t need to register the bike and you don\u2019t need to have insurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the e-bike does not meet the definition it is not legal for use on the road or public spaces.&nbsp; This would include pavements and pedestrianised areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is specifically relevant where motor input is controlled by a twist grip on the handlebar and there are either no pedals or the main propulsion is not by using the pedals.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These machines are treated by UK law like petrol-powered mopeds. This means they must be taxed and insured, you must have an appropriate licence and you need to wear a motorcycle-style helmet to ride them.</p>\n',

Upon checking the garden shed, the bike was missing and entry had been forced.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two padlocks had been snapped and an apparently dropped Nokia mobile phone was recovered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cA neighbour to the burgled address provided footage to police and named the defendant as walking with two other males at 3.45am,\u201d said Ms Johnstone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further CCTV enquiries were made and the motorbike was spotted at 3.22am. \u201cMr Warnock was identified as a potential defendant having been named (the neighbour) as being involved,\u201d added the prosecutor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Warnock was arrested four days later and quizzed three times by police before being bailed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On November 5, at around 2.30am, a male was twice seen trying the door handle of the witness\u2019s address. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Warnock then visited a neighbouring property and, when the witness\u2019s name was mentioned, he stated: \u201cYou two threw us under the bus. I\u2019d think twice about going to court.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an impact statement, the key witness outlined the emotional impact. \u201cI was petrified of coming to court for the original case. He was trying to intimidate me. It didn\u2019t work,\u201d said the witness, who admitted: \u201cI came close to dropping it. It has left me thinking \u2018who\u2019s lurking around, who\u2019s watching?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The witness\u2019s children were woken and had also been affected. \u201cI should be able to give a witness statement if I choose,\u201d they added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defence lawyer Matthew Hopkins, mitigating, spoke of Warnock suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder &#8211; ADHD &#8211; and a prolonged and entrenched history of substance misuse which started when he was 14 but which he was committed to addressing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Warnock, of Drumburgh, west of Carlisle, was given a 10-month jail term by Recorder Eric Lamb after admitting burglary and witness intimidation.</p>\n',

He asked whether she liked alcohol, and suggested a party drink of vodka and cocaine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the chat switched to WhatsApp, Goulding requested indecent pictures and also made a series of sexually explicit suggestions as the decoy amassed a wealth of evidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That information was handed over to Cumbria police along with voice notes containing more suggestive comments by Goulding, who was arrested and interviewed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHe did answer questions in which he suggested he had been set up by a vengeful ex-partner,\u201d prosecutor Stephen McNally told Carlisle Crown Court. \u201cHe denied knowing about the girl\u2019s account and denied conversing with her. He denied having any sexual interest in children.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When brought to court, Goulding admitted offences of attempted sexual communication with a child and attempting to cause of incite a child to engage in sexual activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was sentenced today when a judge heard he had 34 previous convictions for 113 offences, the majority for dishonesty. There were no past sex crimes on his record.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrew Gurney, mitigating, spoke of Goulding\u2019s disadvantaged upbringing and ongoing mental health issues in adult life. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He is disgusted by his own behaviour. He is genuinely, truly remorseful for what he has done,\u201d said Mr Gurney. \u201cThis will obviously have a significant impact on his life moving forward.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Goulding was given a 45-month prison sentence by Recorder Eric Lamb.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He must sign the sex offenders\u2019 register \u2014 and comply with the terms of a prevention order \u2014 indefinitely.</p>\n',

However, as we discussed with the Health Adult Scrutiny Committee, no decisions have been made and there are no final plans to pause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s only right that we talk to our teams first and consult with them on proposed plans to change the way they work as per trust policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis is their opportunity to feed into the proposed plans moving forward; and based on the feedback we have received to date, it is likely there will be some changes to the proposals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOnce we have finalised the revised proposals, we will discuss them with our teams again to ensure we have heard correctly and made the changes required to resolve any major concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe will also share with our commissioners to advise on whether they believe the plans are substantial service variation and therefore, require public consultation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We will then discuss with the Furness Locality Board and HASC as agreed with the committee this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf the final plans hit the threshold for public consultation or a wider engagement piece of work; we will, of course, support that fully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn the meantime, most of the concerns raised by the public surrounding end of life care provision, privacy and dignity of gynaecology patients, etc, are the same themes that have come up in the colleague consultation and we aim to address those in the revised plans in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf we are unable to address them, the changes will not go ahead.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Labour MP also asked the trust to confirm that the gynaecology ward would no longer be single-sex but that there will be single-sex bays within a mixed ward, and queried if a risk assessment had been carried out on this approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A trust spokesman said: \u201cIf the proposals are accepted as they are now, then gynaecology inpatients would be in a dedicated area within Ward 5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Ward 5 is made up of single sex bays where patients do not share a bay or facilities with members of the opposite sex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cA Quality Impact Assessment and Equality Impact Assessment has been completed for these changes which I believe we have shared with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;These are clear that any changes must not compromise the privacy and dignity of women.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to be clear \u2013 if we cannot protect the privacy and dignity of our patients, the changes will not go ahead.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron Cummins, trust chief executive, previously said at the health and adults scrutiny committee meeting that the drive behind the proposed changes to Furness General Hospital is to make sure patients get the right care, in the right place, at the right time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a report prepared by the trust, the proposed changes strongly supported NHS plans for patients to receive care at home or closer to home where appropriate with support from nurses, therapists, social carers, volunteers and doctors in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report said this time last year the trust had around 150 patients not meeting medical criteria to reside in hospitals, but this number has been reduced to around 100 in October 2024 due to work with primary care and local authorities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It added that Parkview Gardens in Barrow which currently provides 16 intermediate care beds will soon be providing 24 beds in an environment to support patients in their rehabilitation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report states no members of staff will lose their job or be required to work at another of the trust\u2019s sites as part of the proposals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chief executive also told council chamber the proposed changes will provide the hospital with capacity for when the population grows with the BAE Systems expansion in Barrow and said Furness General Hospital had a bright future.</p>\n',

Their commitment to our cause allows us to continue providing a safe place for animals in need.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lauren Pickthall, animal rehoming manager at Animal Concern, said: \u201cWe are delighted by the wonderful support from the WCF Cockermouth team and very excited to offer the dogs in our care a special Christmas Day lunch. Roxy has already sniffed the lunches out in the storeroom, so they must smell extra tasty!\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Ulverston, the WCF team has been working with Animal Welfare Furness as pet poverty is a known issue in the area. The festive feasts will be delivered directly to the families most in need, offering a pet food bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma Fawcus, charity manager at Animal Welfare, said: \u201cIt has been fantastic to be partnered with WCF Ulverston this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The team and customers have been a great support to the work we do, and their festive campaign, \u2018No dog should go hungry this Christmas\u2019, fits in wonderfully with our own aspirations of donating pet food to those in need this Christmas. The Christmas dinner boxes will allow us to reach more people in our community with dogs that may have empty bowls without our help.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year\u2019s Christmas Day lunches will feature the Lakes Heritage Festive Feast, an own-brand dog food made for WCF Pet &amp; Equestrian in the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not too late to get involved. Pre-filled donation bags, packed with food, toys, and healthcare items, are available in-store now, with all items delivered directly to local charities.</p>\n',

Discovery Sports remains committed to delivering an action-packed, engaging 2025 FIM Speedway GP series that can be enjoyed by millions of fans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In 2024, we had record numbers of fans watching the FIM Speedway GP series on our platforms and a host of sold-out events, as well as staging racing in front of nearly 50,000 fans at PGE Narodowy in Warsaw (Poland), the world\u2019s biggest speedway attendance in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In 2025, we are incredibly excited to bring the FIM Speedway GP series to the iconic National Speedway Stadium in Manchester, a true heartland of the sport, meaning British fans can still watch their favourite riders live and in-person next season as part of an exciting double-header.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The difficult but necessary decision to replace Cardiff on the 2025 calendar, made in close consultation with the FIM, has not been taken lightly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;However, a combination of logistical challenges, rising\u00a0costs\u00a0impacting the event and its contributing stakeholders,\u00a0and declining attendances have prevented us from positioning Cardiff as an event that met commercial, or spectator attendance targets post-Covid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It is a decision we have made for commercial reasons and a move that ensures the long-term sustainability of the series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We will continue to deliver on our plans to capitalise on the popularity of speedway elsewhere and we support the sustained expansion of the sport at all levels of the SGP pyramid \u2013 ensuring we provide an even more compelling product for fans while helping the sport to grow even further.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2025 FIM Speedway Grand Prix season will start with the\u00a0FIM Speedway GP of Germany \u00a0on Saturday, May 3, when Polish world champion Bartosz Zmarzlik bids to win a record-equalling sixth FIM Speedway World Championship.</p>\n',

They have all been reviewed and judged by the Love Barrow Awards committee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chair of the Love Barrow Awards committee, DT Guest, said: &#8220;This year has seen a record number of nominations from the public, who have nominated local individuals or groups who go that extra mile to support others. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The awards night is a fantastic event, and would not be possible without the support of our sponsors and patrons, and I would like to thank them for once again giving very generously.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each finalist has sat down in front of the camera at the Holiday Inn Express, Barrow and at Furness College to talk about their experience as a community champion, sharing the inspiring stories behind their nomination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The videos will be played on the awards night and shared at the same time on Facebook before the winner of each category is announced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now the Love Barrow Awards committee needs the community\u2019s help. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They will shortly be asking for people&#8217;s support in selecting the winner of the People&#8217;s Choice Award 2025, sponsored by BAE Systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DT Guest said: &#8220;This award is chosen by the public from one of the amazing finalists, and we will be asking them to vote for their community hero.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each year the thousands of votes make the award very, very close! We often don\u2019t know who will win until just before voting stops.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voting for this will open in mid-January 2025, and the winner will be announced at the awards ceremony.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Love Barrow finalists 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Community focused business of the year</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Chatsworth Signs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MKM Barrow</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Charnley&#8217;s Home and Garden</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Teacher of the year</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>David Reddy</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Marion Stanton</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sue Hannan</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Carer of the year</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Valerie Kirkby</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dawn Huitson</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sharon Durdu</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Group project of the year</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Andy&#8217;s Man Club</li>\n\n\n\n<li>128 (Barrow-in-Furness) Squadron RAFAC</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Furness Group Riding for the Disabled</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Citizen of the year</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Ben Tiffney</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maurice Watkin</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jonathan Weakley</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Young citizen of the year</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Jack Hampshire</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lincoln Johnson</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Scarlett Hardman</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Oak Tree Award</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Barrow RNLI</li>\n\n\n\n<li>St Mary&#8217;s Compassionate Communities team</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Inspira </li>\n</ul>\n',

With a focus on local stories, the gallery invites visitors to explore themes such as wild, social, industrial and revolutionary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cultural identity and resilience are at the heart of the new Carlisle Gallery. Visitors can explore objects from the diverse communities that have called Carlisle home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The gallery will also feature\u00a0Faunus, a new work by Nicole Bishop, drawing inspiration from Cumbria Biodiversity Data Centre\u2019s earliest record from 1512.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Art will also extend out of the gallery into the new welcome area.\u00a0Hold Fast, Stand Sure, I scream a revolution,\u00a0a large-scale installation of ceramic mushrooms by Serena Korda will hang from the ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The work was acquired with support from Arts Council England/V&amp;A Purchase Grant Fund, Art Fund, and the Henry Moore Foundation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will open its doors to the public on Saturday, February 15. </p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Tullie-3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-334978" srcset="https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Tullie-3.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Tullie-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Tullie-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Tullie-3-219x146.jpg 219w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The revitalisation of the caf\u00e9 and purpose-built shop are designed to complement the museum\u2019s ethos of inclusivity, creativity and sustainability, featuring locally sourced, bespoke products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shop will be curated much like the museum and galleries, representing local makers, producers and businesses, with unique ranges that are exclusive to Tullie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is hoped the transformed caf\u00e9 will provide a destination dining experience in its own right. It will also be available for private dining events, and weddings, cementing its place as a key part of Carlisle\u2019s hospitality scene.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Properties on Castle Street, unused for years, were transferred to Tullie from Cumberland Council, parts of which will form brand new spaces for the museum\u2019s popular community programme. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tullie\u2019s iconic Gatehouse entrance building has received some attention alongside this work with the help of a grant from Historic England.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Grade I listed building, which is a prominent part of Carlisle\u2019s streetscape, was taken off the Heritage at Risk register following a full refurbishment.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="742" src="https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Tullie-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-334980" srcset="https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Tullie-1.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Tullie-1-300x217.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Tullie-1-768x557.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Tullie-1-201x146.jpg 201w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>This work is part of a comprehensive redevelopment plan focusing initially on the initial welcome and social spaces of the museum. The next phase, which begins in late spring 2025 is set to modernise the 850sq m main first floor gallery spaces and create new learning facilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While work on this second phase is ongoing, the museum has continued to welcome visitors and has recently opened a stunning new Sheila Fell exhibition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exhibition is the first major retrospective in over 30 years, Cumberland on Canvas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fell, from Aspatria, is arguably one of the 20th century\u2019s greatest landscape painters. Her dark and evocative paintings of the Solway plain led LS Lowry to regard her as the greatest artist of her generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sheila Fell: Cumberland on Canvas\u00a0runs until March 16, and brings together close to 100 works from private and public collections with the generous support of the Weston Loan Programme with Art Fund.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The redevelopment work has been made possible with funding by the Government, including support from the Government\u2019s Town\u2019s Fund and Future High Streets Fund.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been further supported with public funding from Government administered by Arts Council England.

Solar panels will also be installed on the roof, energy-efficient LED lighting installed and an air source heat pump to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The market hall is closed and the work is due to be finished in March. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Westmorland and Furness Councillor Virginia Taylor said: &#8220;We\u2019ve had some positive conversations with Government on this funding, including just how much the delays are impacting our beloved town centre, and while they are committed to honour as many of the Levelling Up Fund Round 3 projects that they are able to, we still have a way to go until we receive any terms and conditions or actual funding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So for now we\u2019ll push on with the enabling work at the indoor market and continue to reassess the project should terms and funding be received.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Government acknowledged the funding was being made available in the Autumn Budget earlier this month and discussions are under way to confirm the agreement in order to secure the funding, subject to further Government monitoring, the council said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coun Taylor said the decision to close the market temporarily for the initial work was not taken lightly, but because the work would reinvigorate it.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: &#8220;Kendal has had a market charter since 1189 and Westmorland and Furness Council takes the responsibility of being the market\u2019s custodians very seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We thank the traders for their hard work over the years, but also for the understanding and co-operation throughout this challenging process. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have taken steps to support traders in the short term and look forward to seeing familiar faces back again when the market hall reopens.&#8221;\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John Davison, who sells pet supplies, said: \u201cI\u2019ve taken the leap and leased new premises on the New Shambles, which is a fantastic location to secure the future of my small business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I took the business on from my beloved daughter Jarre a few years ago, and have loved every minute in the indoor market. We are like a family of traders, and we know the community we have built will continue to support us, with a few of us traders ending up next door to each other in the colourful New Shambles! I look forward to seeing what the council will do next with the markets, especially at a time when investment in desperately needed.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Market users and traders have been talking to the council on what they would like to see from the indoor market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discussions took place with traders to explore their options while the Market Hall is closed, and support packages made available to traders to support them through the project and temporary closure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expressions of interest are invited for traders and other businesses who may be interested in operating in the market when it reopens. More information can be found on the council website at <a href="https://www.southlakeland.gov.uk/business-and-trade/markets/">southlakeland.gov.uk/business-and-trade/markets/\u00a0</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the council gets the go-ahead for the wider scheme, the market hall will be closed for longer. </p>\n',

Those landscapes are in my blood, and they\u2019re central to my work.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After completing her studies at the University of Sheffield, Georgina spent six years teaching modern languages in secondary schools in Barnsley and Staveley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, she said, the birth of her first child in February marked a turning point. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: \u201cI wanted a career that offered flexibility so I could spend more time with my daughter, and I realised this was the perfect moment to pursue my art professionally.\u201d</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="676" src="https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Georgina-Hartley-Willows-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-334944" srcset="https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Georgina-Hartley-Willows-1.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Georgina-Hartley-Willows-1-300x198.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Georgina-Hartley-Willows-1-768x507.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Georgina-Hartley-Willows-1-221x146.jpg 221w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Georgina Hartley-Willows </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Not A Blank Canvas launched earlier this year, specialising in bold, colourful landscapes, original artwork, prints, and bespoke wallpaper murals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her first three wallpaper mural commissions are in Carlisle homes.

He passed away during the pandemic, but his guidance continues to inspire my work.\u201d</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="717" src="https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Georgina-Hartley-Willows-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-334942" srcset="https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Georgina-Hartley-Willows-2.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Georgina-Hartley-Willows-2-300x210.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Georgina-Hartley-Willows-2-768x538.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Georgina-Hartley-Willows-2-209x146.jpg 209w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Though Georgina now lives in Sheffield with her family, her connection to Cumbria remains strong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of her pieces pay homage to the landscapes she grew up with, and her work seeks to capture the essence of these special places, she said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: \u201cCumbria will always be home.

But when I turned him over I knew it was something far more serious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAll I kept remembering from my first aid training was the first four minutes are critical. Everything I learned came back to me in the moment, and without that training, I don\u2019t think I could have helped him.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the defibrillator arrived, Carl followed the instructions to administer a shock, attempting to restart Nigel&#8217;s heart before continuing CPR until the paramedics arrived and took over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Lyndsey, Nigel&#8217;s wife, the situation was terrifying. She said: \u201cI was at home when one of the lads\u2019 wives messaged me to call her urgently. She said Nigel had collapsed, and he hadn\u2019t moved for 15 minutes. I panicked, trying to get to the hospital, not even knowing if he would survive. It was the longest night of my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking it one day at a time, he\u2019s not 100% yet, but he\u2019s making progress.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nigel is a senior site supervisor from PPP\u2019s Box Encapsulation Plant Product Store 2, known as BEPPS2 at Sellafield. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lyndsey added: &#8220;The support from his colleagues at PPP and the rugby lads has been incredible\u2014they\u2019ve checked in constantly, and it\u2019s meant so much to our family.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nigel spent nearly a month in the hospital, and his recovery has been slow but steady.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nigel said: \u201cIt\u2019s brought us closer together. This could have been a completely different story.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the incident, workers on the BEPPS2 project at Sellafield requested more defibrillators through an observation system, resulting in the installation of two additional units on site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lyndsey said she was grateful to Carl and the team who saved her husband. She said: \u201cThey were absolutely brilliant. I can\u2019t thank them enough for what they did for Nigel and for us as a family.\u201d</p>\n',

Picture: Inspired Meadows</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Plans are in the pipeline to create a 15,000-plot eco burial site on the edge of Kendal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exeter-based Inspired Meadows already has permission to create a 4,000-plot urn burial site on 25 acres of land off the A65 between Summerlands and Endmoor &#8211; but its long-term aim is to offer full eco-burials. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initial work is taking place to create a main entrance, 200 urn burial plots and planting for around 1,000 trees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The firm gained planning permission for the site in 2019 &#8211; but said Covid had caused major delays to work starting on site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is currently able to facilitate urn burials on site, it is still working on gaining planning permission to offer full eco-burials on site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The firm&#8217;s director of operations &#8211; Ellie &#8211; declined to give her surname, and told Cumbria Crack that the hope was to offer 15,000 eco-burial plots on the site, but also added that the exact figure is to be confirmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellie added: &#8220;It has been quite a lengthy process. We bought the site prior to Covid, so it has been a big delay. It&#8217;s taken quite a few years, which is why the work has only just started, as it was as soon as we&#8217;ve been able to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It has to do with a lot of the testing on the site to make sure people are able to be buried there, that it won&#8217;t affect local water systems and surrounding farms, so it has been an extremely lengthy process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But it is a really exciting time for us now. We&#8217;re really excited to see the progress of the site in the next couple of weeks and months and we&#8217;re excited that our clients that have joined us on the journey are as passionate as we are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A lot of land these days is being used up by houses, so its important that we have something to counteract the damage that the new builds are having on the environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are bringing the environment back to Kendal with our site.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jeg_video_container jeg_video_content"><iframe title="Inspired Meadows: Discover Our Vision with New 3D Artist Impressions" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/megBaS28RWs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspired Meadows currently has planning permission for 4,000 urn burial plots, 36 car parking spaces, toilets and a groundsman&#8217;s store on the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellie said the firm was aiming for the site to be less formal than a conventional cemetery and more of a landscaped natural space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: &#8220;What we are doing is a little bit different to other natural burial sites. We&#8217;re trying to bridge the gap between traditional and natural burials. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Obviously it&#8217;s very regimented in terms of the physical burial process, in terms of you don&#8217;t get embalmed so it&#8217;s better for environment and we use eco-friendly urns or caskets which again contain no toxic chemicals that will harm environment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But a lot of people find natural burial quite scary because you&#8217;re getting put in a field which is unmarked and you&#8217;re not able to walk around knowing there&#8217;s people beneath you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So what we&#8217;re doing is trying to find a perfect blend between a natural and traditional burial by creating beautiful pathways on site and giving people the chance to have a flat to the ground plaque on natural material. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So eventually you&#8217;ll be able to walk through natural gardens to visit loved ones, walk their pets or even have a picnic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Because we&#8217;re planting so many trees and flowers we&#8217;re hoping to create new ecosystems on the site.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The firm held an official launch for the site on November 28 where local businesses and Kendal mayor Jonathan Cornthwaite were invited to look at plans for the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellie added that around 600 to 800 plots can be created per acre and that the site hopes in the future to offer space for up to 15,000 plots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: &#8220;At the moment, the site is a field, but it will rapidly develop over the next few months. It&#8217;s going to happen very quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re a new company, so we&#8217;re working on establishing good relationships with local funeral directors and providers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Kendal and the Lake District in general is a small area so we really want to create partnerships with people who respect clients as much as we do.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will also offer pet burials on site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspired Meadows is aiming to create more sites across the UK, but declined to comment on plans going ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Managing director Stephen Brown set up the company in 2017 after witnessing the increasing demand for sustainable and personalised end of life options. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n',

Signs around the West Cumbrian, Preston and Burnley and West Cumbrian campuses will be one of the first changes people will start to see.

Changing our name allows us to better cement our brand position and build on our recruitment efforts both nationally and internationally.\u201d</p>\n',

Squally showers, hail and thunder are also possible in some places. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The weather forecaster said there is a potential for delays to public transport and some disruption to the road network, which may have a greater than usual impact given the busier pre-Christmas weekend travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It added that dangerous coastal conditions can be expected too, with large waves an additional hazard.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What should I expect?</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are likely</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It\u2019s likely that some coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities will be affected by spray and/or large waves</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Probably some bus and train services affected, with some journeys taking longer</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some short term loss of power and other services is possible</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely</li>\n\n\n\n<li>There is a small chance of isolated, short term loss of power</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="657" height="395" src="https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/weather-warning-one-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-334844" srcset="https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/weather-warning-one-1.png 657w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/weather-warning-one-1-300x180.png 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/weather-warning-one-1-243x146.png 243w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why should I care about weather warnings?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Weather warnings are issued to let people know what weather is in store for their area and what its impact could be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Met Office is the UK\u2019s official weather service and is responsible for issuing weather warnings to the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three main levels of weather warning:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Yellow \u2013 which asks people to be prepared for disruption</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amber \u2013 which asks people to change plans that could be impacted by the weather and take action to protect themselves and their property</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Red \u2013 which is issued for weather that poses a danger to life and asks people to immediately take direct action to keep themselves and others safe from impacts of the weather</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Yellow and amber warnings represent a range of impact levels and likelihoods. This means it is important to read each warning to know what level of impact to expect in your local area \u2013 and how likely those impacts are to occur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Met Office began issuing impact-based warnings in 2011 \u2013 which means that warnings are issued when the weather may have an impact on people\u2019s day to day lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous to this, warnings were issued to the public when certain weather thresholds or levels were reached.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Impact-based warnings take multiple factors into account \u2013 these include time of day, if it may impact traffic, time of year, if the weather is unusual, if there are any seasonal events taking place and if the area is well equipped to deal with the weather.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each warning level is designed to help people take steps to minimise the chances of disruption in their lives.</p>\n',

Kirsten Donald then found Broad out wide on the right and in space.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broad&#8217;s delivery in to the area had enticed Keeper Jess Clayton off her line and saw three would be defenders challenging the sole figure of Barber. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the numerical disadvantage, Barber forced her claim and met the ball after the bounce to lift it over Clayton and in to the empty goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The visitors nearly claimed a third goal with the second half only six minutes old after free kick from just outside of the area from Laura Walker struck Miller&#8217;s far post before being cleared to safety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strikes on goal followed soon after for Bracken and Barber with one sliding past Clayton\u2019s right post and the other flashing over her crossbar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A brave front post header by Keeley Chatters from a Kirsten Donald corner on the left produced a fine instinctive save from Clayton with 20 minutes remaining.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further breaks in behind the North End\u2019s back line from Cassie Donald, Barber and Bracken, and had it not been for the lightening recovery pace of centre back Courtney Woodhead, the home side would have been in on goal.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miller produced a fine fingertip save from a crisp effort from Scott as the game entered the final 10 minutes and in doing so kept the home sides challenge alive.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parity was eventually and justifiably restored with six minutes of the game remaining and in similar fashion to their first goal in that the initial connection started in the back line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Left back Lauren Campbell had carried the ball towards the centre circle before releasing to find Barber. The attacker played the ball back to Keeley Holliday before spinning to threaten again.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Holliday&#8217;s lifted delivery was inch perfect for Barber to take the advantage before she delivered a sweetly struck dipping left footed strike which left Clayton helpless.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ever alert Bracken nearly claimed all three points on offer with less than 30 seconds of the game remaining.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her instinctive run on to a ball delivered from Wagstaff from the right, had left two defenders lagging. However, Clayton had read the danger and was advancing off her line, the ensuing flicked effort from Bracken was all she could fashion, which unfortunately travelled to safety for the visitors.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The game ended soon after with the spoils shared having both teams scoring a pair of goals each.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Barber picked up both the Player of the Game as well as sponsors Westlakes Demolition&#8217;s Player of the Game after a threatening performance throughout and a brace of impressive goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the game, manager Paul Mackenzie complimented the players&#8217; performance over the past four games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: \u201cWe have been in great form over the past month scoring 15 goals and only conceding three. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We were unhappy with certain things in our performance against Atherton, but the way the players have responded since then has been amazing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They have developed a bit more bite and belief and we are all looking forward to taking this form in to the new year.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="256" src="https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Workington-Town-Women-Girls-.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-328129" srcset="https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Workington-Town-Women-Girls-.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Workington-Town-Women-Girls--300x75.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Workington-Town-Women-Girls--768x192.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Workington-Town-Women-Girls--260x65.jpg 260w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Workington Town Women seniors and juniors.

We have seen more growth and development off the pitch over this time than we had in the whole of our previous years in existence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe rebranding to Workington Town Women FC, followed by launching a Reserve Team that are flying, and joining up with what was Allerdale Girls, has meant that we have all been working extremely hard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A special thank you should go to the families that support these efforts and their understanding and inclusion on the direction we are taking.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe also extend our appreciation to everyone that volunteers their time and efforts to support these club and those that come down to support us over the season.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOn behalf of everyone at the club, I would like to wish them all a very merry Christmas and a prosperous new year.\u201d</p>\n',

The blaze also destroyed six businesses and impacted a further 78.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cllr Brook said: \u201cI want to say a few words about the tragic fire that took place on December 8 in Kirkby Lonsdale which led to the death of a much-loved local man and a fire that has seen a significant impact on this community, its residents and its local businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe response of the local community has been phenomenal. In addition what has been truly exceptional is the response of all the agencies working together for one cause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFrom the fire crews and the police to local charities to our very own council officers who have been there working on the ground every single day since the incident happened.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cumbria Community Foundation has launched the Kirkby Lonsdale Fire Disaster Recovery Appeal to address hardship caused by the fire, with Westmorland and Furness Council pledging a \u00a350,000 donation, so that the first wave of awards can be made before Christmas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The council response involved a multitude of officers including those from communities, waste, highways, economic development, housing and communications teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cllr Brook added: \u201cThis tragic incident has shown the power and strength of the local community and Westmorland and Furness Council in action on the ground demonstrating what can be achieved through community power in very difficult circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHowever, there will be a long road of recovery for the Kirkby Lonsdale community and with so many significant impacts from this catastrophe. We and our recovery partners now need urgent central support from Government to help our communities and businesses return to normal as soon as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe were pleased to hear that the Prime Minister has promised Lizzi Collinge MP a meeting with the relevant minister to ensure the right help is received where it is needed the most and I hope that this will include match funding for the disaster recovery fund that has just been launched by the recovery group via Cumbria Community Foundation.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://bit.ly/4gGZq5a">Kirkby Lonsdale Recovery Partnership has issued an update about the town here. </a></p>\n',

We believe every child should have something to open on Christmas morning, so we wanted to take this opportunity as a company to pool our resources and contribute to this meaningful cause.&#8221;</p>\n',

But we hope this will offer extra reassurance to women and girls due to concerns we have been made aware of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve listened to what women and girls have said both to our officers in their everyday engagement and in our survey. One of the concerns raised in the survey was about being a victim of crime in the night-time economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs a result our general policing operation around Christmas this year has had an extra focus on violence against women and girls so we can address these concerns, provide reassurance and catch offenders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhether you\u2019re out in our many pubs, bars or restaurants or you\u2019re simply walking home from work in the dark, WalkSafe is a really handy app to have downloaded to your phone to help you plan a night out or get home in the safest way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt can offer you and your loved ones that extra peace of mind when you\u2019re on your night out or journey home.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lisa Brown, Cumberland Council\u2019s deputy leader and portfolio holder for adults and community safety, said: \u201cViolence against women and girls is one of the top priorities of the Community Safety Partnership, and we\u2019ll do all we can to combat it and help everyone feel safe in Cumberland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis app is an incredible tool in helping people feel less vulnerable, and in offering peace of mind to their friends and family. I hope it is well used, allowing everyone to have a great night out in Carlisle, and get home safely.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paul Dickson, Armstrong Watson CEO and managing partner, said: \u201cArmstrong Watson is proud to be a corporate partner in the launch of the new WalkSafe app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis project is testament to our commitment to fostering a secure and inclusive environment within our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are excited to see this innovative app being rolled out in Carlisle and we believe it has the power to provide reassurance and peace of mind to those who choose to venture out after dark and enjoy the Carlisle nightlife.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are delighted to support Cumbria Constabulary, the University of Cumbria and Cumberland Council with this initiative for the city.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gail Howes, head of student services at University of Cumbria, and Daniel Prescott, of the University of Cumbria Students\u2019 Union, said: \u201cIt is important to remember that Carlisle and Cumbria are very safe places and the WalkSafe app is another tool for anyone to have, particularly those who may be new to the area and are learning to navigate themselves around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEveryone deserves the right to feel safe when walking in the city and this app with its safety features such as a route planner and SOS button is a good way towards achieving that.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WalkSafe has previously been rolled out in 35 towns and cities throughout the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app also highlights features like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Venues that operate the Ask for Angela scheme, where people can ask a member of staff for support by asking for Angela.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On-street support, such as the Safer Streets Welfare Hub in Carlisle city centre.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma Kay, WalkSafe Founder, said: &#8220;We are thrilled to be launching in partnership with Carlisle on the WalkSafe+ app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe know that 63 per cent of women prefer to visit pubs, bars and restaurants that have safety initiatives in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur national safety map allows users to see exactly where these venues are and plan safer experiences when accessing the night time economy.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scheme is being run through the Cumberland Community Safety Partnership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a body made up of six statutory partners: Cumberland Council, Cumbria police, Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service, the probation service, and the two integrated care boards that operate across the area, along with many other non-statutory partners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main purpose of the partnership is to reduce crime, disorder, anti-social behaviour, substance misuse,\u00a0re-offending and other behaviour adversely affecting the local environment.</p>\n',

This will lead to a huge increase in noise and low-level disorder, as occurs when people get together late at night.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to the objections, a representative from Domino\u2019s stated the takeaway would have signs displayed asking customers to leave the premises quietly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The branch also has 24-hour CCTV in operation both internally and externally that covers the full area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The applicant said it operated other late night Domino\u2019s stores and continually monitor the situation with customers and if there were any issues, it was prepared to engage a door supervisor if required. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr Abdul said the group operates fast food outlets throughout the UK and added: \u201cWe\u2019ve never had any police complaints.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sub-committee said: \u201cAlthough the sub-committee had considered the concerns of the two residents that submitted written representations, the sub-committee were of the view that the concerns raised did not justify refusal of the application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe sub-committee attached weight to the fact that no responsible authorities had objected to the application, notably Cumbria Constabulary had submitted no objections.\u201d</p>\n',

We look forward to being able to continue to assist the charity in any way we can.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kylie Palmer, corporate fundraiser, said \u201cWe can\u2019t thank James and his team enough for their support. We love the reason behind this reward. Everyone wants to return home safely after work &#8211; it\u2019s a place of sanctuary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For the Biffa team to achieve that goal and then use their reward to help others spend their time in their sanctuary is truly special. As a charity, we want to give people that choice, and thanks to Biffa\u2019s generosity, we can continue to support that mission.\u201d</p>\n',

Obviously it will help the efficiency of the business and reduce costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBut we are also acutely aware that pubs use a lot of energy in cooling beer and generally running the establishment and, as responsible business owners and with all the issues surrounding energy and global warming, we need to be seen to be doing the right thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis is especially important as we employ a lot of young people and they need to be able to look up to business owners and see that the businesses are being run in the right and proper way.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The panels, which have begun to supply around 25 kilowatts of energy this week, are  facing south on the roof of Ye Olde Fleece Inn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris said: &#8220;It has been a long process, working closely with Westmorland and Furness Council as the Fleece is a listed building. It is great to see the council\u2019s forward-thinking attitude when it comes to listed buildings and sustainability.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that a big review focusing on sustainability was now taking place at the duo\u2019s other hospitality ventures in Kendal &#8211; The Gateway Inn near Plumgarths roundabout, The Duke of Cumberland at Appleby Road and Bootleggers in Market Place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe want to reduce our costs but also because it makes sense to do all we can to be more sustainable to help the climate,\u201d said Chris.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPubs have been around for hundreds of years but times are difficult and we have to make sure they remain a cornerstone of the community.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ye Olde Fleece Inn at Highgate had been closed for 18 months until the site was acquired by Chris and Josh. After a nearly \u00a31 million renovation project, it reopened for business in March 2019.</p>\n',

In addition, over 2,200 acres of other habitat will be restored including montane scrub, wildflower grassland, heather moorland and 992 acres of peatbogs.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stephen Trotter, CEO of Cumbria Wildlife Trust,\u00a0said: \u201cWe\u2019ve reached another important landmark in the story of Skiddaw Forest: our purchase has formally completed. This is wonderful news, as we begin the important work of restoring this iconic site in the northern Lake District Fells.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re starting by carrying out in-depth, baseline surveys across the site, from small mammals such as otters, weasels and stoats, to the so-called \u2018lower plants\u2019 such as bryophytes, lichens and liverworts, which play a vital role in the ecosystem. In addition, we\u2019ll survey water quality and flow rates, and check the depth and erosion of the peatland. So the exciting work is already getting underway, in this long-term project which will come to maturity in the coming decades and well into the next century.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re extremely grateful to Aviva and our other funders, and to the over 7,000 members of the public who donated to the purchase of Skiddaw Forest, enabling us to take this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to restore nature on a truly landscape scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Thank you so much to all of you and we look forward to working with our many local partners, farmers, volunteers and others to make this vision a reality that everyone will enjoy for generations to come.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fundraising continues for the restoration work on the site. The charity\u2019s vision is to create a mosaic of healthy, resilient and revitalised mountain habitats, it said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 620 acres of temperate rainforest will be created with native trees that are adapted to live in an upland landscape. Due to the altitude of planting, the trees will be low-growing and fit sympathetically with the aesthetics of the landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Training of seed-collecting volunteers started in the autumn and will continue next year. The native seeds will be taken to new tree-growing hubs in Plumgarths near Kendal, Cold Springs Community Nature Reserve in Penrith, and a site near Keswick where the saplings will be grown on, before eventually forming part of the new temperate rainforest at Skiddaw.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To contribute to the restoration of Skiddaw Forest, go to\u00a0<a href="https://www.cumbriawildlifetrust.org.uk/skiddaw-forest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.cumbriawildlifetrust.org.uk/skiddaw-forest</a>\u00a0or call Cumbria Wildlife Trust on 01539 816300.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n',

He made an immediate impact with some strong carries and offloads to lift the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the stroke of half time Wigton moved the ball well, releasing young winger Jordan Wood and he went 50 metres beating three defenders for a well taken try. Armstrong added the extras to give his side a 15-10 lead at the break.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This proved to be the turning point as Wigton came out energised for the second half and dominated possession and territory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A tiring home pack could not disrupt the speed of ruck ball as well as they had been doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following a burst up-field from Charlie Bell, captain Ryan Wannop took the inside ball and galloped 25 metres for the score with Armstrong converting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Promising young back rower Bell then made another burst up the blind side and this time finished it off himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next score came from good hands along the backline that released Roco Okesene into space and he scored in the corner on his return from a three-month break. The conversion attempt was charged down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The young Egremont side came back and led by a powerful back row and some lively backs caused the Greens to defend several phases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following a couple of rucks close to the line an Egremont forwards crashed over for a try.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the kick-off Wigton won a turn-over and drove close to the line. Although Okesene was stopped five metres out Joe Marrs was able to step his way through two tacklers to score Wigton\u2019s last try.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the last play of the game Egremont were awarded a penalty try from a deliberate knock on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a good performance from Wigton in an entertaining game where both sides tried to move the ball around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next for the Greens is the toughest test of the season so far, unbeaten Penrith 2s away on January 4.</p>\n',

Before you go out this Christmas and New Year, make sure you plan ahead so you are not tempted to get behind the wheel.\u201d<br><br>Cumbria\u2019s Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner, David Allen, said: \u201cThese results &#8211;\u00a0 our police arresting 96 people so far in December for driving under the influence \u2013 are nothing short of remarkable and show that the force is tackling the scourge of drink or drug driving seriously.<br><br>\u201cIt is, however, truly appalling that 96 people thought it was appropriate to get behind the wheel and drive after drinking or taking drugs.<br><br>\u201cDriving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is an incredibly selfish and dangerous act. Not only does it place your own life at risk, you pose a serious risk to other road users.<br><br>\u201cIn Cumbria, this is not acceptable behaviour \u2013 the force will be carrying out more checks of drivers over the festive period and enforcing the law &#8211;\u00a0 If you are caught, you will face the consequences.<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t end 2024 by being arrested, or worse, taking someone\u2019s life, because you couldn\u2019t be responsible and stay sober or drug free.<br><br>\u201cI would urge everyone to enjoy the festivities but to drive safe, drive legally and do not ever drive drunk or under the influence of drugs.\u201d</p>\n',

Dackers made it 3-0 from the spot kick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On 35 minutes Dackers completed his hat-trick when a scuffed shot wrong-footed home keeper Casey Sillitoe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It became 5-0 at half-time when Paul Lewis fired across goal for Harvey Macadam who squeezed it in at the back post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morecambe picked up where they left off and scored again in the 51st minute. A ball in from the right was met by a thunderous half-volley from Paul Lewis, which gave Sillitoe no chance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morecambe brought on further experience at the break, with ex Carlisle forward Hallam Hope and Jordan Slew joining proceedings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was Hope who added the seventh on 59 minutes, as he finished calmly from six yards after he was picked out in the box by a low cut back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this play became very scrappy and there was only one more goal with Hope netting his second from a late penalty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carlisle United: Sillitoe, Rigby (Rafferty 72), Hodgson, Skinner (Bell, 55), Fleming, Porter, Murray, Lowes, O\u2019Donoghue (Smith, 63), Fitzpatrick (Lambert, 55), Hopper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morecambe: Burgoyne, Millen, Tutonda (Slew, 45), Songo\u2019o, Taylor, Harrack, Brown (Macadam, 25), Jones (White, 63), Dackers (Hope, 45), P.

Picture:  Google Streetview.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Barrow&#8217;s Forum could be closed for up to two years from next March. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The news was revealed as Westmorland &amp; Furness Council&#8217;s cabinet agreed to recommend that an extra \u00a36 million be pumped into the \u00a317.5m scheme to revamp the market hall after asbestos was found by additional investigations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Full council will make a final decision at a meeting next month and the cash will come from funding that has already been approved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scheme is an integral part of wider ambitions to help Barrow become a more attractive, thriving and vibrant place for people to live and visit, being delivered through the \u00a3200m Team Barrow programme working with the Government and BAE Systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the next phase of asbestos removal \u2013 due to begin at the end of March \u2013 will require the use of heavy machinery that will cause vibration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The council said it had commissioned an independent expert assessment of the likely impact on the neighbouring Forum, which shares some of its structural components with the market building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It said: &#8220;This assessment has determined that there is a risk that asbestos, currently safely contained in the Forum building, could be disturbed by the works starting in the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This means, to protect the public and staff, the council has taken the difficult but responsible decision to close the whole of the Forum building while this work on the market hall is carried out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Initial estimates suggest this phase of work could take around two years.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Councillor Virginia Taylor, Westmorland and Furness Council\u2019s cabinet member for Sustainable Communities and Localities, said: \u201cWe have now received that report and it is clear that, in the interests of the safety of everyone, public, performers and staff, we will not be able to keep the Forum open while those works are being undertaken in the market hall. \u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe temporary closure of The Forum is hugely regrettable and will clearly impact on shows and events planned for next year and beyond. I am really sorry this has to be done and would like to apologise to everyone who will be inconvenienced by the closure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI know the Forum staff are particularly disappointed by this news but will be pulling out all the stops to ensure we do our very best for our customers, promoters, local groups who enjoy their turn on the Forum\u2019s stage and everyone else who uses the Forum. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank our staff, who work so hard year-round to make the Forum a great venue.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Events before the work starting in March will go ahead as planned, including this year\u2019s Christmas production Santa Express.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The authority said it was working with promoters and event organisers to see if it could relocate or reschedule shows and conference facilities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It added: &#8220;We are also looking at options to relocate the popular caf\u00e9 and toilet facilities.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tickets for events scheduled for post-March 2025 are being taken off sale immediately. Should those events be subsequently rescheduled for an alternative venue, ticket sales will be reopened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no risk to current users of the Forum building, including customers and staff. No traces of asbestos have been found in air quality tests and the building will remain open until the next stage of asbestos removal works at the market hall start at the end of March 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theatre space in the Forum building is currently closed following a roof leak which disturbed some asbestos above the main theatre, but this has been safely isolated with the closure of the theatre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All other asbestos in the Forum building is currently safely contained. Any risk associated with asbestos in the Forum only becomes an issue if it is disturbed by the heavy machinery work in the market hall, which will not start until the end of March 2025.</p>\n',

Market Street remains closed to both vehicles and pedestrians, with a cordon in place to ensure public safety. Demolition work on structurally unsafe buildings is underway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The appeal is focused on individual hardship caused by the fire and will broadly support the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>People who have lost their homes and possessions to the fire and been displaced, and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>People who are suffering hardship due to business closure linked to the fire and the loss of income to their households.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If funds allow, community recovery activities</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Immediate hardship needs are being met through the distribution of grant awards by Cumbria Community Foundation, in partnership with Westmorland and Furness Council and the Kirkby Lonsdale Community Cupboard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grant awards will be made by a committee composed of representatives from the Community Foundation and the Kirkby Lonsdale Community Recovery Partnership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Angela Jones, of Westmorland and Furness Council and chair of the Kirkby Lonsdale Community Recovery Partnership, said: \u201cThis fire has caused significant financial hardship and emotional distress to those directly affected and also to the whole community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The full impact of the fire is still emerging, but recovery is likely to take many months, if not years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The community response has been amazing, but many people and businesses have been significantly affected and will be affected for the long term. That is why is it essential that we raise as much money as possible to help support the community with their recovery plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are also working alongside the local MP, Lizzy Collinge to lobby Government for match funding and if we are successful that means for every pound donated the Government would match the same amount.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Councillor Paul Cassell, chair of Kirkby Lonsdale Town Council and a member of the Kirkby Lonsdale Community Recovery Partnership, said: \u201cThe primary aim of the fundraising is to support all families and individuals affected by the tragic fire that has devastated our beloved town. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have witnessed so many unseen acts of support and help and give our sincere and heartfelt thanks to all those who have been kind enough to donate. Recovery is going to be a long process, please support this appeal if you can.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andy Beeforth, Chief Executive at Cumbria Community Foundation, said: \u201cIt is tragic to see such devastation and loss of life in this beautiful market town. The team at the Community Foundation have significant experience of managing disaster appeals and we will bring all our fundraising and grant making skills to help the people of the town.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe have set an initial target to raise \u00a3100,000. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The people of Kirkby Lonsdale have responded magnificently to help their neighbours and friends. They have provided practical and financial support including temporary accommodation, food, clothing, emotional help, the use of holiday homes and a number of GoFundMe pages have raised funds to help specific people and the wider community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We look forward to working with the Kirkby Lonsdale Community Recovery Partnership to support people in their recovery from this horrific episode.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The foundation is working closely with the Kirkby Lonsdale Community Recovery Partnership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The foundation is also co-ordinating its efforts in relation to the Lunesdale Hall GoFundMe page which has now been closed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The appeal is being promoted and supported by Westmorland and Furness Council, Kirkby Lonsdale Community Recovery Partnership, as well as by local news media, regional and national newspaper groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Donations and funds are being sought from:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Individuals and businesses</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Grant making trusts and local, regional and national charities</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Community fundraising events</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Existing and new government funding programmes</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Support for businesses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Westmorland and Furness Council is co-ordinating efforts in support of local businesses including seeking government support for grant aid and suspension of business rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charitable appeals are unable to support businesses directly. The appeal can support business owners and employees experiencing financial hardship as a result of the fire.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">To donate </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Visit <a href="https://cumbriafoundation.enthuse.com/cf/kirkby-lonsdale-fire-disaster-recovery-appeal">https://cumbriafoundation.enthuse.com/cf/kirkby-lonsdale-fire-disaster-recovery-appeal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out more about the fund, visit <a href="https://www.cumbriafoundation.org/fund/kirkby-lonsdale-fire-disaster-recovery-fund/">https://www.cumbriafoundation.org/fund/kirkby-lonsdale-fire-disaster-recovery-fund/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phase one of the fund will provide immediate short-term relief of hardship. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on funds available, it hopes to make further grant awards in early 2025.

This initiative aims to enhance the perception of Carlisle, increase social value, and ultimately boost economic performance by attracting more residents and visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe artwork we are proposing is part of a wider project to make the city centre a more vibrant and lively destination and to encourage increasing footfall. As a council one of our values is to work collaboratively and we are always looking for new methods of engaging new audiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The artist will work closely with the project team and the building owner to develop a proposal that compliments the area. The design will be signed of by both the North place Project team, North Area Place Programme Board and The Lowther Arcade building owner.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it gets the go-ahead, it will take 10 to 14 days to complete and work would start at the end of January. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lowther Arcade is a Grade II-listed building which was dated 1904 for the Carlisle Old Brewery Company by Henry Higginson of Carlisle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interior wall which has been selected for the mural is not part of the listed elements of the Lowther Arcade and is currently painted white. </p>\n',

The first floor will provide a multi-purpose community space for uses such as health and wellbeing mindfulness/yoga classes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The application said: \u201cThe proposed surgery will provide a public space for patients and staff, futureproof the needs of the patient population and will also create a much-needed central hub for an ever-increasing rural population.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Haverthwaite GP surgery has nearly 3,000 patients and offers healthcare to people in hard to reach areas of western Windermere and Coniston.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In January the Lake District National Park Authority approved plans from John and Helga Barr to offer the Oak Bank in Haverthwaite as an emergency surgery and the property has been used as such since April 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The applicants are now working with Haverthwaite Surgery &amp; NHS Lancashire and South Cumbria ICB to secure a permanent standalone solution in the grounds of Oak Bank that satisfies Care Quality Commission best practice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A report prepared by the authority&#8217;s planning officers said: \u201cThe proposed development would ensure the continuation of an important community facility.\u201d</p>\n',

The Millom Town Deal Board and Cumberland Council remain committed to delivering the Town Deal projects for the benefit of the Millom and Haverigg communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leader of Cumberland Council Mark Fryer added: \u201cThis will be an important step forward for the Millom Town Deal projects. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It is great to see progress being made. Work continues on other parts of the Town Deal projects and momentum continues to build across this transformational programme.\u201d</p>\n',

They then took on a much longer effort which also sailed over to extend the lead to nine points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The visitors were putting the effort in but were unable to put the home side under any sort of pressure or create any momentum as they kept making simple mistakes.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="573" src="https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Sam-Wilson-getting-the-ball-into-the-Leek-half-with-Sonny-Askins-about-to-receive-the-ball.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-334410" srcset="https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Sam-Wilson-getting-the-ball-into-the-Leek-half-with-Sonny-Askins-about-to-receive-the-ball.jpg 1024w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Sam-Wilson-getting-the-ball-into-the-Leek-half-with-Sonny-Askins-about-to-receive-the-ball-300x168.jpg 300w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Sam-Wilson-getting-the-ball-into-the-Leek-half-with-Sonny-Askins-about-to-receive-the-ball-768x430.jpg 768w, https://cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Sam-Wilson-getting-the-ball-into-the-Leek-half-with-Sonny-Askins-about-to-receive-the-ball-260x146.jpg 260w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sam Wilson getting the ball into the Leek half with Sonny Askins about to receive the ball.
